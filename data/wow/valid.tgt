people just like food shows , top chef actually got so popular that they made another show called " top chef junior " , it features y ##pu ##ng contestants in their early teens , it was premiered in october 2017 on universal kids .

masters should definitely help , its sounds counter intuitive but if you go for a phd it can make it easier to get your schooling for free . at least it does in engineering
if you can get into a masters program , it shouldn ##t be too hard to get into a lab just gotta network and get in with the right people .
have you seen frozen ? it ' s based on an old hc ##a fairy tale : " the snow queen . " it ' s nice to see old stories get updated treatments !
olaf and a lot of the other characters ended up being too symbolic in the screenplay drafting process . the original fairy tale was just that good !
kris ##to ##ff reminds me of me when i was in my early twenties : tall , rugged , and handsome . i definitely qualify for that last one . . .
it would be a great drinking game to play . every time a character exactly resembles you or a friend , take a shot !

my favorite piece is the " goldberg variations " which is an instrumental composition bach is known for .
i believe a variety of instruments though i don ' t know specific ##s . i could easily find out because the piece debut album actually came out in 1955 ! so recent !
i ' m thinking about taking lac ##tai ##d tablets to avoid having gas and nausea every time i consume lac ##tose .
i was happy to learn that lac ##tose into ##ler ##ance does not cause damage to your gas ##tro tract ! still , i need to avoid consuming too much of it , it isn ' t a pleasant feeling !
i agree . at least i was prepared for this , i was aware that as you age , it ' s more likely you will get primary lac ##tose into ##ler ##ance .
yeah and you can even get what they call secondary lac ##tose into ##ler ##ance due to injury of the small int ##est ##ine .
yeah , jamaica is a great little place just south of cuba and west of his ##pani ##ola ! nice beaches !

wild , their paired organs aren ' t side - by - side and they only have one lung , because of their narrow body .
you hear they can , but i doubted it , but some species have a pe ##l ##vic gi ##rd ##le and vest ##ig ##ial claws on either side of the cl ##oa ##ca .
there were many , but that elongated , leg ##less body of a snake really creep ##s me out , so i couldn ' t watch long .

the sc ##ul ##pt ##ural process originally was performed in two ways . first was carving ; that is , the removal of material from a block of wood or stone , for example . the second way is modelling , which is the addition of material ( clay for example ) on another material .
in the early period of sc ##ul ##pt ##ing , such as the classical period , for the most part materials were limited to stone , metal , ceramics , and wood . however , since " modernism , " the materials used are almost limit ##less .
if you are interested in sc ##ul ##pt ##ing , and you want it to stand the test of time , the best material to use is stone . other materials , such as wood , per ##ish quite quickly in the process of time . sc ##ul ##pt ##ing with pottery is your second best option if you find stone too difficult to sc ##ul ##pt .
yes , the primary songwriters lennon and mccartney were highly influential on the evolution of pop music
it ' s true ! in 1969 , lennon privately told the other members that he was leaving the group

yeah it is ha ##ha , but not as tough as what the native people of the pacific do , they surf on ala ##ia pa ##ip ##o and wooden bark trees

i ' m the owner of the business and an up ##hol ##ster ##er and i have an apprentice called an outside or trim ##mer .
he watches and learns while i up ##hol ##ster things like automobile , airplane , and boat seats mostly .
it is pretty hard sometimes . we do everything by hand building each layer up .

that ' s too bad . it was created by richard garfield and published in 1993 .

my favorite stamp , my most prized stamp is one they made for calvin and ho ##bbe ##s as part of a series on newspaper comics . it is one of the only officially licensed pieces of calvin and ho ##bbe ##s merchandise , ever .
i might want to see if i can scare up a few more copies of the stamp , just for poster ##ities sake . i think i felt the same way my grandfather did when he collected thing ( he collected coins , bt ##w )
collecting stamps a great way to support the post office too , which is se ##mming ##ly under siege by some stupid law about paying 75 years of retirement benefits or something like that .
i think i have watched halloween before ! that ' s the one that takes place in had ##don ##field , illinois ! what are the purge movies about ?

parenting seems like a process of predictable sequences , but they may turn out different for each child .
i ' ve heard that the quality of parenting likely matters more than the amount of time spend with the child .
that ' s very true . in some cases , society also plays an important role in raising a child as well .
i agree , it is hard . studies tend to have trouble identifying the impacts because respondents often respond to feel ideal rather than how things are .
understand ##able . it ' s supposed to be " fest ##ive " , right ? ! and no doubt on the grammar , as alcohol makes a bee ##line for the brain ( and other organs , like the heart , liver , pan ##cre ##as . . . . ! )
ah , well , and there you hit on my preferred tip ##ple . tequila . and i had no idea about scotch ! so how do you stay true to * not * drinking ?

roger that . i ' ve got sc ##ot in my blood , so i ' m thinking my body would rebel against anything less than a single mal ##t .

i do ! it ' s similar to a hostess cup ##cake with a cr ##eme filling , but way better , in my own biased opinion ! lo ##l
i do love it ! interesting ##ly , before mu ##ffin tin ##s were in pl ##ent ##iful supply many people made cup ##cake ##s in individual pottery cups !
yes , and they are quite popular with my customers ! english fairy cakes are popular too - they are a bit smaller than a normal sized cup ##cake
me too . despite this , i can ' t deny the fact that cheese is popular among others and hundred of types of cheese are produced from multiple countries .
the style , texture and flavor all depend on where the milk comes from and if they have been paste ##urized and aging process .
some cheese are just simply cu ##rd ##led milk . but some cheese incorporate herbs , spices , or wood smoke as flavor ##ing agents .
i also forgot to mention other ingredients like black pepper , garlic , chi ##ves or cr ##an ##berries can be used .

the first ones that came out in 1953 were hand built and all of them were painted polo white .
the year after that they were also available in red and black . they were sold slowly . i ' m guessing because they were probably so expensive .
yes ! it originated in 17th century europe , so i can see how it evolved to art , basically .
it takes a lot of dedication . another cool fact about europe is that the fall of the roman empire happened in ad 47 ##6 and this kicked off the middle ages .
i do , it ' s fascinating . there ' s 3 distinct periods of it , early , high and the late middle ages . what about you ?

the north ship
i also like fairy tales with folk ##lor ##ic fantasy characters , elves , and unicorn ##s !
those books are awesome ! jacob and wilhelm grimm were so talented ! i also like the tv show called grimm that was based on their stories !
that ' s for sure ! interesting ##ly , most fairy tales have a european tradition origin and are mostly related to literature for children .
i like the lp the best , i like how it is made of shell ##ac because prior records were scratch ##y and thick .
digital sound is really clean , but there is a nice way that the record sounds .
well , to tell you the truth , i think it is because of sound vibrations , sound ##wave ##s that are recorded by some sort of etc ##hing ? maybe it can be impressed too , and it is onto a rotating disk then it is called a record .
my favorite record is pretty in pink , by the ps ##ych ##ade ##lic fur ##s , have you heard it ?

it was set in seattle and filed in la , california .
the series was originally supposed to be racial ##ly diverse . meredith grey is the main character .
its all about preference ! there are terms used to refer to hiking by different countries .
in the united kingdom , and the republic of ireland , the word " walking " is acceptable to describe " all forms " of walking ,
i ' m not done yet ! the bank is not exhausted just yet . more ##so , the term bush ##walk ##ing is endemic to australia , having been adopted by the sydney bush walkers club in 1927 .

oh yeah chemicals are so bad ha ##ha . thankfully r ##ha ##zes di ##sti ##lled alcohol for the first time way back between 85 ##4 and 92 ##5 ce , otherwise we ' d be dry ha ##ha !
i know , it ' s crazy ! also the " - ol " at the end is to indicate that it contains a hydro ##xy ##l functional group .
not as far as i know , as the risks are very hard to avoid . one thing to note is that alcohol used to only refer to ethanol , which is used as a drug .
i ' ve never had it . growing up , my dad used to buy us el ##lio ' s pizza . they were founded in 1963 in long island , ny .
actually , it was frozen pizza . it was " 9 slices " of pizza in a box comprising 3 rectangular pizza ##s , each di ##vis ##ible cross ##wise into three slices . i will still buy it from time to time just because it reminds me of my dad . i am not a fan of chicago pizza .
thin crust . it ' s usually topped with additional vegetables or meat ##s , but i prefer mine with french fries on top .

well , the way they work is they ' re an analog sound storage medium , right , and so it ' s a flat disc that has these spiral grooves that are inscribed and mod ##ulated onto the disc
well this important groove that the ph ##ono ##graph player needle settles on to play the music , it starts near the periphery and then goes all the way to the center of the disc !
you ' re right ! it ' s interesting you want to collect ph ##ono ##graphs , because since the late 1980s , digital media / compact discs took over the market share and has had it since then
that ' s a fair point . they ' re still useful in today ' s world , as they ' re used by disc jockey ##s and listened to by niche market audio ##phile ##s , possibly like you
its the oldest tr ##adi ##ton ##al form of smoking
ye ##a its such an old traditional form of smoking be ##cu ##ase of native american and such

a lot of his works and installations are in public spaces around scotland .
he typically uses things like teddy bears and newspapers for his work
some of mach ##s work has been used to cause a reaction and stir controversy
im not sure about who created it or when bb ##ut the phrase ice cream can actually mean different things in different country . it appears countries have their own word or variation for it
we ' ve got frozen cu ##star ##d , frozen yo ##gur ##t , so ##rb ##et , gel ##ato . these can be different names and / or different variations of ice ##cre ##am in different countries including america .
yes it is nice ! also some products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream gets the label frozen dairy dessert instead .

i am a bit of a k ##lu ##tz . i switched over to piano lessons and chorus . my children are exceeding me in music now .
cool . do you have a favorite production ?
i love productions in general but get frustrated when i can ' t follow the storyline . i am always impressed by well - done scenery and costumes .
well since the beginning it has always been eddie ve ##dder ( lead vocals ) , mike mcc ##rea ##dy ( lead guitar ) , stone go ##ssar ##d ( rhythm guitar ) and jeff am ##ent ( bass ) .
they have way to many to choose from . in 91 ' they burst into the spotlight with the album ten ! it was their debut album .
well they were one of the key bands in the gr ##ung ##e movement . so i think the best song on ten in my opinion is even flow
last time i checked it was nearly 32 ##mill ##ion records in the united states and an estimated 60 ##mill ##ion worldwide
then you might want to check out cold deserts ! they exist in polar regions of our planet .
there are cold deserts in india adjacent to the him ##ala ##ya mountains ! it ' s supposed to be beautiful !
most people think of deserts as hot and dry , but deserts can be classified by other things such as location , amount of precipitation and temperature . maybe the cold deserts exist because of their geographical location .
you ' d probably be working with a lot of kids who have certain behavioral disorders , like ad ##hd or add , and maybe even some developmental disabilities , like autism .
i ' m not actually sure , but i would think so ! there are a lot of different teaching procedures and materials for special needs kids .
definitely ! there is always a need for special education teachers . there are other kinds of disabilities you may be working with , including kids with physical disabilities and certain learning disabilities , like d ##ys ##le ##xia .
i ' d say there ' s a need in every division ! just remember to be flexible , because every kid will be different . it ' s important to remember that every kid will have different needs .
yes i know it can also be a risk at times depending on the price but that ##s why i want to learn to do it the right way .
you ' re right it is about taking a risk i ' m thinking about investing in 2 out of the three categories which is public finance and personal finance .
that ' s what my husband said as well he did finance for paying a debt obligations though and after doing that he got a small stock open to test it out i think i will start off investing about 500 dollars minimum .
yes it was but he not as dedicated as me now he been into his credit rating and paying interest payments so he still kind of staying on track with finance lo ##l .
it has two team with nine players each .
yes ! there are even multi - purpose stadiums designed for different types of events !
wow ! that is interesting ! mvp baseball was a baseball game series with 5 games produced !
i do not know however i know a lots of them are native to europe and southwestern asia . i am curious as to why they are cultivated .
i suppose . i think it may have to deal with global ##ism and adoption of mer ##can ##tis ##lism as well as needing to trade .
mer ##can ##ti ##lism is essential economic policies designed to maximize the trade of a nation and its supply of wealth .
yes . it also could be said to be a small factor in trade and economic histories of counties like the united kingdom in that era .
i know that curry is a popular spice used in indian cuisine ! some currie ##s are spice ##d with leaves from the curry tree !
i thought it was just a spice but apparently curry is a catch - all term that refers to a number of indian dishes . i wonder if it ' s spicy ?
yes , a lot of indian cuisine includes rice and vegetables . indian food is ever evolving because of the nation ' s cultural interactions with other societies .
there are tons of ways to make it , there are so many traditions of the dish , ab ##ru ##zzo , sicily , and other places in italy
tomato sauce originated in italy , but it has changed a bunch just with variations
my family is very italian and i would say it is about even , but usually we eat sa ##ua ##sa ##ge as its own dish , although i am not a ah ##uge fan of it most of the time
italians actually mock that type of meal because they serve meat ##balls with egg based baked pasta , which is not how we do it , weird how pre ##ten ##tious some people are
i also like the tonight show starring jimmy fallon . guess i just like jimmy fallon , lo ##l .
i just found out he was on s ##nl for six years , before moving on to star in movies . he was in taxi and fever pitch .
hosting s ##nl ' s weekend update made him a celebrity and i guess that ' s how he got into movies .
as well as his television work he has two comedy albums and five books .
yeah , now days its more geared towards online shop ##ip ##ing . , where you can shop worldwide and have it shipped anywhere .
it ' s called b ##2 ##c , business to customer and it makes it easy to quickly select from a retailers website and have it delivered
not sure . i guess when the internet started , eighties
indeed . he wrote the first bas ##ke ##ball rule book and founded the university of kansas basketball program .
he was a ph ##ys ##ica ##n , chaplain , coach and inn ##ova ##tor and of course invented basketball . he was a busy man !
i just love to play basketball three on three or two on two with my mates . my fa ##v player is jays ##on tatum boston celtics . what about you ?
oh brilliant . i love to watch them . i tried explaining basketball to my gran the other week , explaining the objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop which is mounted high at each end of the court . i was hoping she would watch the game with me but my explanation didn ##t sell it to her !
ye ##a they are really messy but so simple , just melted cheese and tor ##till ##a chips
yep , besides tor ##till ##a or cheese it was usually just meat ##s or ve ##gg ##ies in some different form
which is again just corn tor ##till ##a with meat ##s and cheese and pepper sauce
mine too . i also like romantic fiction but i prefer historical fiction .
have you ever heard of the historical novel society ? they promote historical fiction .
h ##ns considers historical fiction as any novel written fifty years or more after the events that it is depicting .
not just cigar ##ret ##es . but i enjoy the smell of cigar smoke , in all their variety of sizes and shapes .
no i haven ' t , have you ? how is it like ? of course that smoking in general has negative health effects .
i know cigar ##s are made prima ##rel ##y in central america and the ii ##sl ##and in the caribbean .
and in some cultures smoking is part of rituals to , with the idea of inducing trance - like states
the worst part is the thought of dust mit ##es and they are creep ##ily climbing everywhere .
well i have asthma and unfortunately positive tests for dust mit ##e all ##er ##gies are extremely common .
yeah mainly because of the dust ##mite ##s , luckily the dust becomes heavy and settles and you can clean them up frequently . but you better wear a mask .
absolutely also dust mit ##es are a nesting species and prefer the dark and warm climates so making sure you have a lot of natural light can help prevent it and find it .
i have not , i had a close neighbor who drove one for many years . he liked being gone all the time though , he might be a rare case . have you driven one ?
most drivers are responsible for their own safety as far as the truck is concerned . they are made to inspect for any issues related to safe operation . but you may be referring to being around so many other drivers ? !
you ' re right , some have a vehicle mass greater than 12 tonnes
you ' re interested in becoming a truck ##er ? it ' s a decent living , but like you said before exhaust ##ing and scary depending on who you ask !
i prefer the pools , we have an olympic - size swimming pool near us , which is the largest size they get . it ' s great for building endurance .
swimming and running are probably the most common , cycling is good too . i like to mix in strength training to build up my skeletal muscles , build strength , and increase my ana ##ero ##bic endurance as well .
it can be tough sometimes , i just think of all the benefits strength training provides like increased overall health and well - being and increased metabolism , for instance , when i need some motivation .
that ' s great ! did you or any of your teammates go on to pal ##y for the nhl or any other league ?
anytime a college can recruit athletes from high schools to add good athletes to the roster is not only great for the college and team , but also helps the students a lot too .
ha ##ha ! i can ' t either . anytime i have tried i have been afraid that the blades on the boots would stab me when i fell .
oh my ! i ' m sorry ! don ' t let my crazy thoughts scare you away from trying again . i ' m just a wo ##rrier like that .
i usually go to bed at around three in the morning - right before i go to bed is when i feel the most energetic !
i know ! i could never be an early bird that goes to sleep early and then wakes early ! that ' s not for me !
it ' s funny that in scandinavia early birds and night owls are called a - people and b - people lo ##l
maybe i have a delayed sleep - phase disorder - that ' s one explanation for being a night owl
va ##gan ##ism also rejects meat and that rejects the commodity status of animals , meaning animal products
well religion , vegetarian ##ism is strongly linked with a number of religions that originated in ancient india
well in jain ##ism , being a ve ##get ##aris ##m is mandatory
i do ! they were also part of the midwest division of the western conference .
i ' m not sure ! they were established in 1995 as part of the nba ' s expansion into canada .
i don ' t think they still play , but i ' m not positive . they were based in vancouver , british columbia .
they won 101 games , but lost 35 ##9 . so they didn ' t qualify for the nba playoffs .
i ' m not really sure . i ' ve been busy watching casualty the british medical drama more often .
i ' m not sure . casualty takes the british medical drama takes place in ho ##lby city .
it ' s about typical medical drama stuff and it airs weekly on the bbc !
do your glasses protect your eyes from the sun like sunglasses ?
i ’ ve always wanted to try some smart glasses . it ’ s like having a small computer you wear on your face !
yeah i totally agree . i always hope to test them in the mall or best buy .
yes , it can be . the creator actually made it after making two animated films " the life of larry " and " larry & steve " .
me either . the show has such dark humor , though , that it is has received a lot of backlash from the organizations like the parents ' television council .
yes , but is what the show is known for : offensive jokes , violence , disturbing images , and gore .
yes , i guess it ' s not for everyone ' s taste ! fox even cancelled it in season 3 with one una ##ired episode left . adults swim then picked it up and aired the episode and finished the run .
the world cup , put on by the international federation of association football ( or fifa ) , has many games left this cycle . we still have 18 more group matches before elimination play .
the last fifa world cup was played in 2014 with germany being crowned the winners .
indeed , it has happen every four years since its inception in 1930 save 1942 and 1946 for wwii .
the lu ##mba ##r is the most common area which pain can occur . it also supports most of the body weight .
the dull may be a dull ache , shooting pain or a pain that is piercing or burning feeling .
there are internal structures such as pan ##cre ##as , ao ##rta , kidney ##s and gall ##bla ##dder may also experience locations for back pain .
it is just a great show ! the series takes place in a romantic ##ized stone age setting
yeah it is neat ! it was originally broadcast from september 30 , 1960 .
i always though it was really funny , the continuing popularity of " the flint ##stones " rested heavily on its ju ##xt ##ap ##osition
i have heard in 2013 , " tv guide " ranked " the flint ##stones " the second greatest tv cartoon of all time
there are places like cost ##co , sam ' s club , pub ##li ##x , food ##lion , and al ##di ' s
i would not rec ##com ##end sam ' s club i just gave it as an option , but al ##di ' s is a brad in over 18 countries .
it was started in germany in 1964 by brothers karl and theo albrecht .
it is mostly groceries , but i have been in al ##di ' s and they usually have pretty good , and cheap produce , as well as other items too .
yeah , she got started singing in church during childhood . she sang gospel as a teenager .
her name was kate hudson but adopted her stage name " katy perry " for her first successful album in 2007 .
yeah , that ' s probably one of the reasons she changed it . she became famous in 2008 when her 2nd album was released containing " hot n cold " and " i kissed a girl " .
that ' s a good one too . some of her other hits are " california gu ##rl ##s " and " fire ##work " .
i like how beautiful ariel was , and her dream of becoming human was sweet .
i like all of the disney renaissance movies . that was an era where disney movies thrive ##d . beauty and the beast was another one part of that era .
yes ! i love the music too . but for some reason , the little mermaid had the best soundtrack to me . part of your world was a great song !
i love that one too ! part of your world stuck out to me because it expresses ariel ' s strong desire to become human .
there was a spanish explorer that visited in 151 ##3 . i think that ' s who gave it the name but i ' m not certain
i can imagine . it ' s the only state that borders the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean . with its placement it ' s perfect for it
miami is the most populated urban area but i ' ve heard of a lot of beaches that are calm compared to there . just have to look around
sure can . it goes back to the 11th century .
many reasons i ' m sure . recreation , entertainment , art or sport .
you ' ve done it ? i think it would be fun to jug ##gle knives , fire torches or chains ##aw ##s .
of course ! i ' m kidding . i will stick to balls , clubs , or rings .
we are not exactly sure yet . . . he is part hound , and a mix . we are thinking he might be a jack russ ##el . is your pu ##g social and gentle ?
queen victoria had a passion for pu ##gs , in the united kingdom .
yes . pu ##gs were brought from china to europe in the 16th century .
that is so cute , the king charles span ##iel seems like a good small breed dog .
ye ##a i remember when the the xbox 360 came out , it was a fantastic developed by microsoft . i play mine all the time .
well it is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service with free monthly games , so i guess it has to cost some money to run the service .
that ##s wild and to think that thing sold over 24 million units sold , people really got it for the games though and didn ##t care at that time about netflix ec ##t . but yeah i agree paying to watch net ##lf ##ix is so dumb .
ye ##a but when the xbox came to the united states in november 2001 , no one really cared about graphics all too much , they just wanted fun games , the original xbox console had similar graphics to ps ##2 and some better in most cases .
8 . 5 million people if you can believe it ! that ' s 40 % of the population of the entire state ! i love how diverse the city is , don ' t you ?
new york city is actually the premier gateway into the us for legal immigration . because of that over 800 languages can be heard throughout the city !
absolutely ! so much opportunity ! new york city is actually known as being the media , cultural and financial capital of the world ! it ' s also huge in the political , sporting and entertainment industries !
for sure the world trade center and empire state buildings . but many tourists also like to visit wall street . it ' s an eight - block - long street . i never realized it was that long , did you ?
wow , that sounds very intense but psychologists are trained for this and can help her to improve her mental health whilst going through this rough time . they can also evaluate and come up with solutions for the entire family as well
i am sure she can find some more info online . but it will be a good thing if she can get evaluated so as to ni ##p any mental disorder in the bud that may be exasperated by this event .
oh wow that must have been challenging for them because these disorders can really imp ##air ones ability to personally function . they have patterns but you really are not able to know something until you can identify what you are dealing with
it certainly had a talented cast , with people like jennifer an ##isto ##n , matt perry , and lisa ku ##dro ##w among others .
she ' s a great actress for sure . it ' s hard to imagine the show was originally titled ins ##om ##nia cafe , it sounds so out of place .
it was extremely popular for sure , the series finale was seen by 52 . 5 million people , that ' s insane !
surprisingly it didn ' t reach the top spot on the tv season ratings until the 8th season .
different hitch ##ers use various signals but i just use my thumb . how bout you ?
in some african countries on the other hand have their hand out wil ##e the palm is facing upward .
yes they do . another example of a hitch ##hi ##king gesture is in australia . it is more common to use a gesture where the index finger is pointed at the road .
i know . pretty cool !
there are deserts in arizona . because of the lack in vegetation the surface is un ##pro ##tec ##ted . it can be really hot .
ye ##a maybe so . the desert covers one third of the land around the world .
lizards and snakes mostly . deserts do not get much rain although there can be down ##pour ##s occasionally . this can cause floods .
insects most likely . there are also polar deserts . this is because deserts are determined by how much rain an area gets .
they are nice too , dog was the first species to be domestic ##ated and bred for over a millennia !
no , it was dogs actually . their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely at ##tu ##ned to human behavior , cats came from ancient egypt i think
me too , they were protected in egypt , dogs vary widely in shape , size and colors , but they all came from wolves , crazy right ?
dogs perform many roles for people , such as hunting , herd ##ing , pulling loads , they were really mans best friend , and help ##er too !
ha ! i ' m in good company then . boxers are only the seventh most popular breed of dog in the u . s . but if you ask me they ain ##t nothing short of the best !
i don ' t believe they are ! but , they do have very strong jaws . lucky for us most of them consider us friends !
they were a mix between the old english bulldog and the now extinct bull ##en ##bei ##sser .
its common name was german bulldog .
if you like hard apple cid ##ers , you have to try rum and coke with coca ##0 ##cola orange . it has a more citrus taste .
ya rum and coke may be made with any type of rum or cola . often lime juice is even included . citrus tastes in rum and coke are great
i would suppose so . coconut has a smooth taste too . i may even be so bold as to say using a little pin ##a cola ##da cocktail could really bright ##en the drink .
little known fact about coconut ##s is that it used to be spelled cocoa ##nut ?
i like to read nonfiction works mostly as i find it reading such things helps me with my critical analysis abilities .
i ' m not sure , and there ' s no consensus on the origins of human language , but i imagine it ' s been going on for several thousand years at least .
i ' m not familiar with it , is it a work that allows you to explore the text deeply in your interpretations ? that ' s one of the great benefits of having no concrete laws in reading .
i found out bee ##ts are not only used for food but also food coloring and med ##ac ##ine
bee ##tro ##ot juice was also used in wine to color it in the middle of the 19th cent ##uary

i think there a lot of foundations and programs educating teenagers on teen ##aa ##ge education
yes i think it is , but teenage pregnancy in developed countries is usually outside of marriage , and carries a social stigma in many cultures and groups
i think america has the highest rate because according to research conducted in 2014 , 249 , 07 ##8 babies were born to women between 15 - 19 years old
yes , 60 % ended in live birth , 15 % ended in mis ##carriage , and 30 % in abortion .
it ' s about moving between different geographical regions by various methods
well , it ' s hard to say . it varies by person . it really depends on personal preference . some people like to travel by foot , bicycle , auto , train
the cheap ##est way would be on foot . if you could go anywhere , where would you go ?
the best waves suitable for surfing are found in the ocean , but lakes also are a good place .
you also can utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools .
or you can try body boarding . it con ##sit ##s of riding wave on a body ##board , either lying on their belly , drop knee , or sometimes even standing up on a body board .
steve jobs was the one who invented it - and interesting ##ly , the iphone has a virtual keyboard !
yes , sadly , he passed away in 2011 . i was quite the american entrepreneur !
i meant he was the american entrepreneur , not me ! the iphone does sell well , and has gps navigation and can record notes !
gps is awesome ! i like that it can display the position on a map and offer directions - i ' d literally be lost without it !
i never grew up on a farm , but i ' ve lived in rural communities .
i find livestock farming interesting . livestock can be used to make so many items , not just food .
what do you like about farming ?
right . and cattle can be used for dairy and meat products .
what ' s your favorite ? mine is chocolate , but you need to use fresh cocoa
i love frost ##ing , but only on vanilla cake not chocolate
probably ba ##ke when bread was first invented , someone just like sweet bread and bam ! cake !
i love cup ##cake ##s , cup ##cake ##s are the best cakes .
well we can start with their first hit released in 1962 , love me do .
well around 1963 when their en ##er ##mous popularity first emerged as beat ##lem ##ania they released all i ' ve got to do for example .
yes it ' s hard to imagine they initially built their reputation just playing clubs in liverpool and hamburg starting in 1960 .
i think it would be that they are a demographic of nordic military .
the one about the inhabitants of viking home communities during the viking age ?
oh yes , good old historical fiction , where the stories are taken from past settings .
people like them as pets and as ve ##rmin hunters !
and there are over 70 breeds of cats according to various regis ##tries !
it is interesting ! and cats can see in near darkness .
cats also have a lot of babies and a very high breeding rate .
pizza is one of the most popular foods in the world ! many different places have their own semi - unique way of making it
yu ##p ! pizza was invented in naples
oh i do too . it gives it more crunch . it ' s usually sold fresh or frozen
ye ##a , it ' s never been that great to me . i don ' t get it either , but there are many chain restaurants that special ##ize in pizza doing it
its a physical exercise . its just more med ##itative and spiritual . different people practice for different reasons .
ancient india .
very old . around the 5th and 6th centuries .
my role is to attend to visitors and serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public . .
for about 10 ##year ##s now . do you know that the world ' s largest and most visited museums are the louvre in paris .
it had about 7 . 3 million visitors all over the world in 2016 .
that ' s known as " brad ' s drink " , well first introduced . pepsi has a cool story that is
can you believe the original ingredient of coke is ko ##la nuts and coca leaves ? now that ' s nuts !
i would drink their concentrate by the tap ! hey , was that cocaine plant that was once in it ?
wow ! that floors me . and people say it isn ' t healthy but i don ' t mind high fr ##uc ##tos corn syrup . i don ' t drink it often so it ' s ok
what are your thoughts on the intersect between religion and science
i was shocked to learn that only 33 % of the worlds population is christian . i would have thought it would be more .
it ' s still considered the world ' s largest religion .
you are one of 2 . 4 billion followers !
yes there are over 100 types . unfortunately for my friend , hers wasn ' t really caused by anything she did . was your grandmother a tobacco user ?
definitely more scary . tobacco is no joke though . it causes 22 % of cancer deaths and is responsible for 85 % of lung cancer . i hope you do not smoke !
i am glad to hear that : ) i think the next biggest causes of cancer are obesity , infections , radiation and environmental poll ##uta ##nts .
i think air pollution is the biggest risk with environment poll ##uta ##nts . in america , around 60 % of people live in areas where air pollution has reached un ##hea ##lth ##y levels , but it has been getting better over the last decade .
i ' m thinking of getting a sewing machine . the machine can probably attach the material with thread better than me .
yes , and using a modern sewing machine and the automated process of stitch ##ing would save so much time .
yes , but it shouldn ' t be too difficult . they are designed for one person to be able to use them .
it would really be great though to be able to master one of the oldest textile arts .
wow , you really are a fan of tool ! i think my favorite album by them is " under ##tow " which really made them a dominant act in the alternative metal movement act .
i feel like tool was never the same after they replaced their original bassist paul d ' amour with justin chancellor in 1995 .
yeah , i definitely remember that . man , can danny carey play those drums , he makes the band come alive sometimes . he really carried the band in the songs " cold and ugly " , " hush " , and " part of me " .
well , back to the topic about the band tool . it ' s amazing what they have accomplished in the rock industry considering they were formed in 1990 .
i hadn ' t heard that ! they do have the perfect climate for orange ##s , as it varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south
i know that miami is an urban area , and is the most populous of the urban areas in florida
awesome ! interesting ##ly , the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean has a peninsula of which florida occupies about two - thirds
yes , that ' s right ! the keys are actually a coral ca ##y archipelago which is situated off the southern florida coast
well in japan it was commonly associated with emperors . also i like barney who is purple .
it is the children ' s tv series " barney & friends " that i watched a lot when i was a kid .
yep barney is the main character who is a purple dinosaur . it premiered in 1992 .
i ' m not totally sure but they originated in the us in the mid - 19th century .
they ' re both very common worldwide nowadays .
maybe . flat ##bread is british ( or european ) and was invented all the way back in the 1700 ##s !
surfing actually started with the poly ##nesian ##s
i would assume so , in hawaiian language the art of surfing " he ##ʻ ##e ʻ ##ana " ( " he ##ʻ ##e " means " to surf "
the part of surfing that scares me is actually standing up on the board which the poly ##nesian ##s invented
but winds ##ur ##fin ##g also looks cool , its where you combine surfing and sailing
once , i almost got carbon mono ##xide po ##ising from smoking too much
yes with all the negative effects smoke has on our health , i am lucky i was able to stop .
very true , that ##s why a lot of countries have smoking ban ##s that prevent people getting second hand smoke
that is tragic , i heard that as well that tobacco smoke causes disease , disability and death .
ac ##rop ##ho ##bia for me is either not wanting to fall or being really high up , so i hate un ##st ##ur ##dy ladder ##s and i height sturdy airplanes
ye ##a ac ##rop ##ho ##bia doesn ##t play much into most aspects of life but heights are ho ##rri ##d when i have to face them
ye ##a things like ac ##rop ##ho ##bia are common since heights are dangerous
ye ##a i think ill have ac ##rop ##ho ##bia for as long as heights are a thing ha ##ha
well , specialized hospitals are available to potentially reduce healthcare costs .
a district hospital is usually the biggest one in its region , with vast amount of beds for intensive care and long term care .
plus , a teaching hospital includes medical students and nurses .
clinics are useful , but smaller than a hospital .
i ' ve done it a few times . it involves carving shapes out of raw wood .
nah i just self taught myself through practicing with random pieces of wood .
so have i and they are so gorgeous . you car ##ve the wood with a knife .
the dressing up portion is like halloween . it started in the 1920 ' s as a form of therapy . it ' s live action role playing games which people are specific characters and have specific roles .
the first la ##rp ##s began in the late 1970 ' s which were inspired by fictional tales and table games .
i actually watch a documentary on the subject . they have rules and guidelines too . you have to ab ##ide by these rules in order to play the game .
yeah some even so trusted enough to become the " newspapers of record " which means their journalism is trusted enough to be consensus fact .
they can make about $ 45 , 000 a year , definitely more that the aforementioned " newspapers of record " like the new york times and boston globe and such .
oh yeah you gotta go to one of the premier journalism schools , to learn how to cover things like politics and business , even weather .
weather reporters are called meter ##ologists . and despite their constant criticism for " getting things wrong " they are prized members of any journalism outfit .
oh no it was from japan . even in w ##w ii when the military was stationed in okinawa , karate was popular there among the men .
oh definitely . the movies that came out in the 60 ' s and 70 ' s helped to increase the popularity of it around the world .
yu ##p , i wouldn ' t doubt it . there are schools all over the place . they usually interest those that have a somewhat interest in it to a deeper connection with the art .
i ' m sure he would . japan even had a club for it at the university there back in 1924 .
violin is a lot of fun ! it has a nice hollow wooden body , and produces a pleasant sound .
yeah ? the electric guitar or acoustic ? i play the six string ##ed acoustic .
cool , it ' s not hard to learn . there are plenty of good youtube tutor ##ials also . the violin is interesting because it ' s the smallest and highest pitch instrument in its family .
we do so because they are such a common and widespread animal and they make us eggs too , they have a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011 worldwide , pretty wild right ? .
indeed , it blows my mind too every time i think about it , chickens are such an important animal for both agriculture and human survival .
its because we have more than 50 billion chickens that are raised annually on farms as a source of food , for both their meat and their eggs .
yep and its a good thing that in the usa , the national organization overseeing poultry production is the food and drug administration they make sure the chickens are healthy to eat .
bro ##cco ##li " comes from the italian plural of " " , which means " the flowering crest of a cabbage
its classified as it ##alic ##a cult ##ivar group of the species " brass ##ica ole ##race ##a " .
we have three commonly grown types of bro ##cco ##li .
bro ##cco ##li sp ##rou ##ts are three - to four - day - old bro ##cco ##li plants that taste like ra ##dis ##hes
that ##s very interesting , another fact about them is that they are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets
yeah that ##s very weird ! another fact is that they are often valued by humans for companions ##hip
i agree they are very loving , also they are valued for their ability to hunt ve ##rmin .
he worked on gravitational singular ##ity . i don ' t know what that means , but it sure sounds important !
in 2002 , he ranked number 25 as one of the 100 greatest brit ##ons .
yeah wow i wish i could do that . his book " a brief history of time " broke the record of being on the best seller list for 237 weeks .
yes ! the game of throne ##s was adapted from " a song of ice and fire " written by george martin .
i have only seen a few episodes myself but i know that the series was created by david ben ##io ##ff and d . b . weiss .
yes , i believe it is quite ri ##sque which probably explains why it is so popular in today ' s society ! lo ##l
the actors on a game of throne ##s are also quite attractive which also explains why so many people tune in to view .
aw ##w ! well i hope she does not get it . if she does , it will typically happen between the 4th and 20th week .
definitely start her on some pre ##nat ##al vitamin ##s now . tak ##in them before may decrease the risk .
there is also evidence that ginger may help .
that would be nice . even with all the studies down , it is still unknown what causes the sickness .
i ' m not sure , probably thousands ! in 2013 , netflix started making original productions as well as online distribution .
it was in 2007 that netflix started putting out streaming media , but they kept the dvd and blu - ray rental system .
the first series produced by netflix was " house of cards " in 2013 .
stephen king was born in 1947 , so i guess he ' s 71 ? what a prolific writer !
i ' m not sure when the first one was published , but stephen king has written 54 novels and over 200 short stories !
stephen king focus ##ses on horror , the supernatural , and suspense . my favourite of his books is the shining .
yes it was the shining was made in 1980 , three years after the book was published . i ' ve heard stephen king hated the movie .
because i love potatoes and anything fried .
yes , in france they call them baton ##net .
i guess , i really prefer shoes ##tri ##ng fries cause they are thin ##ly cut .
they are similar to ll ##ama ##s and are often confused with them until you try to eat them !
i don ##t know about that , but they are closely related and are even cross - bred now
probably since jesus was around , they are usually kept in herds that graz ##e on the level heights of the andes of southern peru , western bolivia , and ecuador
thanks , when you aren ##t eating them , you can use the rest of their body to make blankets , sweater ##s , hats , gloves and scar ##ves !
oh sure , running in sl ##eet or snow or hail would be awful !
is that why the runners are sometimes called " ha ##rrier ##s " ?
wow , that would be really unfortunate . it must have been a gr ##uel ##ing race . there ' s an english championship that was the first national competition , started in 1876 !
well you ' d wanna get a board and go to the ocean , since waves suitable for surfing are primarily found there .
you ' d have to talk to someone who has actually tried it . you could try body boarding instead , since you ride a wave on a body ##board laying on your belly .
i really don ' t know , especially because there are so many different types of surfing , like knee boarding and surf matt ##ing .
it depends since you can either surf in the ocean or utilize artificial waves like from boat wakes and wave pools .
yes it is but is made with fe ##rm ##ented yeast and is one of the oldest and most consumed forms of alcohol
wine is of course made from grapes , it is fe ##rm ##ented without the use of sugar ##s or acids
i am not sure what the most popular or expensive wines are but it would be based on the type of grape it is made from and how old it is because wine gets better with age
china has its longest history in china
do you like the big breeds or the small breeds ? i like boxers as they ' re medium sized , and short - haired so easy to groom .
i ' ve been studying a little about dog nutrition due to how many different brands of dog food there are , what do you feed yours ?
definitely , i try to focus on good quality meat ##s as their short gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tracts are built for it , but i was thinking about trying other foods , any suggestions ?
that ' s a good idea , i eat pretty healthy myself so i was thinking of maybe making my own dog food , but probably easier to buy it already made huh .
mostly the nintendo classics like ze ##lda , pokemon , and mario games . they were a huge part of my childhood .
ye ##a there is a lot of history to the company itself too , it was founded in 1889 and produced hand ##made hana ##fu ##da playing cards as its main business ? pretty crazy .
yep , later on in 1963 they tried to expand into other niche businesses as they had no clear market at the time and even did cab service and love hotels .
oh yes i have , i also found out there are different colors of sk ##unk ##s
the can spotted , brown and white , grey and white , but they all have a " warning stripe "
not sure about that , but can you believe people have sk ##unk ##s as pets in the united states
the league is called fiba and was established in 1935 . i ' m surprised basketball is that popular in europe !
apparently the lithuania men ' s national basketball team has made them a serious force of the sport in europe .
lithuania only has a population of 2 . 9 million but the country is very devoted to basketball .
i don ' t know about that but basketball is the most popular sport in their country .
i love cats . there are more than seventy recognized cat breeds !
i ' m not sure what the most popular is but i do know that cats can see in near darkness which is just great .
cats can hear sounds well above the frequency range humans can here . that ' s really interesting to me .
i didn ' t know that ! cats are great companions though and excellent hunters . do you know any other interesting facts about cats ?
they ' re both jack russell ##s . crazy little guys . also , dogs are a member of the ' can ##is ' genus
oh they get along fine with each other and are generally friendly to people , but they do tend to bark and jump on them . dogs were the first species to be domestic ##ated !
yes ! dogs and gray wolves are sisters ( technically speaking ) . the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct now , though .
oh yes , it ##hey do change periodically . dogs vary in shape , size , and color so there are lots of variations . by the way , how friendly are boxers ?
it definitely is a lot of fun , though sometimes i prefer less limited - contact sports .
that ' s a good reason to like it . the objective is to get the ball through the hoop , of course .
it really is super simple . the hoop is mounted to a back ##board which makes it a little easier .
what kind of candi ##es do you normally eat ? cara ##mel ##s ? hard candy ?
do you prefer your cara ##mel ##s to be soft and chew ##y or hard ? there are so many kinds !
have you heard of squirrel nut cara ##mel ##s ? they ' re chocolate flavor ##ed , chew ##y , and have peanuts mixed in . they make them in a factory nearby me .
no , but i know it is baked and usually ref ##ri ##ger ##ated ha ##ha .
yeah ! i love the layer with cream cheese and rico ##tta , and not particularly .
i ' ve been there ! not to often , but when i want a sweet dessert !
it ' s great ! the original formula was invented in 1940 .
it was invented by tennessee beverage bottle ##rs barney and ally hartman .
i ' ve never been there before . one thing to note is that the formula was revised in 1958 so we aren ' t drinking the original .
well we could go old school and nos ##tal ##gic with 3 of the biggest + bad ##des ##t : led ze ##pel ##lin , black sabbath , and deep purple ! did you have a favorite ?
yes to black sabbath and oz ##zy . like lots of genres , it ' s seen its share of offs ##hoot ##s and evolution - - like the 80s " g ##lam metal " movement with groups like mo ##tley cr ##ue and poison !
late 60s and early 70s , largely in the uk , interesting ##ly . for some reason , it seems very american to me .
interesting ##ly , its roots are in blues rock and psychedelic ##a - - so right in line with the time it was born . of course it ' s got a much bigger , massive sound . and loud !
8 , 53 ##7 , 67 ##3 as of 2016 can you imagine that many people in one huge city ?
new york city is the media , financial , cultural capital of the world influencing so many markets
new york has five counties or bo ##uro ##ugh ##s queens , man ##hat ##ten , staten island , brooklyn & bronx
not sure but new york is linguistic ##ally diverse because people speak 800 languages there , can you imagine ?
i know they were established in 1995 along with the toronto rap ##tors as part of nba expansion to canada .
yes they struggled in the early years but they won a total of 101 games but lost 35 ##9
who knows why anyone support these losing teams ? at least the dolphins are florida ##s oldest professional sports team , i guess that could be a reason to support them .
i know that following the 2000 - 01 season they relocated to memphis , ten ##ness ##e
one part that is interesting is that older civilizations used god ( s ) to explain certain natural processes , like the sun rising .
pretty much , une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d things scare people so they need to explain them to put themselves at ease . especially back then with limited scientific knowledge .
i believe that much of it is due to the rise of christianity , which is the most popular mono ##the ##istic religion ever and still is .
well in almost every single religion , god is om ##nis ##cie ##nt , om ##ni ##pot ##ent , and om ##ni ##pres ##ent as well .
i have trouble understanding them occasionally . the band achieved success with the release of their five studio albums .
they have a lot of good songs . must be why three of their albums were debuted on the " billboard " 200 .
i know what you mean ! they ' ve also nominated for four grammy awards for the song " b . y . o . b " .
yes mic ##hea ##l phelps won like 23 gold medals !
i enjoy swimming and it is consistently one of the top public recreational activities
the good thing with swimming versus running is that swimming is " low impact " which is better for people with joint issues
since the human body is only slightly less dense than water , water supports the weight of the body during swimming
no its closer to bermuda .
it has long beaches , sand dunes , marshes , and maritime forests , so it has a unique topography .
i would love to visit there too but don ' t take a ship as they have had 600 ships wrecked there !
there are categories of vega ##nism .
dietary vega ##ns " ( or strict vegetarian ##s ) refrain from consuming animal products , not only meat but also eggs , dairy
ethical vega ##n " is often applied to those who not only follow a vega ##n diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives , and oppose the use of animals f
we also have the vegetarian eco ##fe ##mini ##sm is an activist and academic movement which states that all types of oppression are linked and must be era ##dicated ,
i usually get my fix at the texas state fair . turns out a patent was filed for the name in 1927 .
ke ##tch ##up or mustard ? it was introduced to the us by texas germans .
that doesn ##t sound too good . its kind of weird that people spell it either corn dog or corn ##dog .
i also never though about the fact that ir resembles corn . i always though it was called a corn dog because of the batter .
i like to grow useful plants , like leaf ##y greens , herbs , and tomatoes . it ' s reward ##ing !
we eat what we grow . i just have a small garden , and many of the plants are in large and small containers .
i consider gardening to be really relaxing . once the plants are actually planted , it ' s just a matter of watering them and pulling weeds every now and again . try it !
there are lots of benefits . you get fresh ##er food and you save money !
i haven ' t ever tried it . it started as meat ##s in a pudding . i would think they used pudding as we do gr ##av ##y
in the u . s . and canada we mean a sweet milky desert . that ' s the way i ' d like to keep mine .
over here made from scratch it ' s usually boiled but most other places its baked
yes , that sounds good ! a lot of people just use the je ##ll - o line of products , like you and i
the civic is in ##bet ##wee ##n the honda fit and the accord . it is a newer model , it has upgrades that most cars nowadays have .
it has front wheel drive , better interior space and it is becoming more fuel - efficient .
yes it is always rising . the very first civic was made in 1972 but as a two - door then a hatch ##back came that september .
i ' m sure it will , that is what makes it unique . it is constantly being re ##bad ##ged for the markets overseas .
i think that ' s the one i ' ve seen in florida . i saw a group of about 15 which they called a pod .
swimming with dolphins would be great ! they weren ' t killer whales , the largest dolphins , were they ?
i don ' t understand this . killer whales are considered dolphins , and they feed on fish , seals , and . . . wait for it . . . dolphins !
dolphins are supposed to be very smart , aren ' t they ?
the salsa ' s movements are derived from several other dances ' forms , including puerto rican bomb ##a and pl ##ena , cuban son , cha - cha - cha , ma ##mbo , and others !
yes , but it actually originated in new york in the mid - 1970s !
i believe that was only one variant , as different regions have their own variations on salsa . some of the more known styles are cuban , puerto rican , cal ##i colombia , l . a . , and new york .
bob marley was one of the best singers to exist and also really helped push weed as something that is not a problem
medical cannabis is such an important tool , its nice that it is becoming something people don ##t think is bad anymore
jamaica even has it legal ##ized due to marley ##s influence , what a great island country
yep , usa ##in bolt is from the country jamaica and he is probably the best runner to ever live
you choosing dogs as pets is wise . dogs being associated with humans has encouraged them to become uniquely at ##tu ##ned to human behavior , which has led them to be so much more better suited to co - exist and be pets with humans over other can ##id species .
i ' m glad to hear it . but of course affection isn ' t the only role they play . the serve in hunting , herd ##ing , pulling loads , protection , assisting police / military , and also helping those who are handicapped or who need therapy !
ha ##ha , understood . and yes , german shepherd ##s are highly popular , as well . on another note , interesting ##ly , new research has found that dogs have mutations to equivalent genetic regions in humans , where changes are known to increase soc ##ia ##bility and lower intelligence !
it can be if you don ' t know what you ' re doing , the kay ##ak was actually created thousands of years ago by the inuit believe it or not
well speaking of the old kay ##aks , they were actually made of drift ##wood and sometimes whale skeleton was used to construct the frame !
i would imagine they ' ve become more advanced since then of course . especially since they became so popular amongst europeans by the mid - 1800s .
i knew moth ##balls were pest ##icide but i wasn ' t aware they helped to prevent snakes from entering .
the national pest ##icide info center helps us by providing objective information on pest ##icides . i wonder if there is an effective method of preventing snakes from entering .
i will definitely keep that in mind . i live in a hot and humid location and i ' m sure we have tons of snakes around here !
i lived in charleston , south carolina for twenty years before moving here to florida . i did see a lot of snakes there !
i really like meteor ##a in 2003 .
i like how they adapted nu metal and rap metal .
there seventh album " one more light " is one of my favorites .
yeah it is a good thing . animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called ob ##liga ##te car ##ni ##vor ##es
i think rats do , om ##ni ##vor ##es also consume both animal and non - animal food
a car ##ni ##vor ##e at the top of the food chain is called a apex predator
that ' s great ! so am i . i enjoy going to vega ##n festivals to try out new foods and products . many festivals have great music !
the great thing about vega ##n festivals is that many times admission is free so that non - vega ##ns will come and check it out !
i ' ve brought many non - vega ##n friends . they ' ve enjoyed the music and the food . it was eye opening for them . . . ed ##uta ##in ##ment at its best !
i appreciate going to vega ##n festivals because i know all of the products i ' m eating are strictly vega ##n . i can just relax and enjoy myself .
awesome . i remember disco was hugely popular through the mid 1970s to the early 1980s . it really was a different time .
i remember listening to disco and doing the bump and the hu ##stle on the dance ##fl ##oor .
i really like the sounds of disco . the string sections , electric piano , and the electric rhythm guitar were so unique .
i wonder what disco was like when it was just house parties . they would make makeshift disco ##the ##ques .
i played mario ka ##rt a few times with my kids when they were younger on our wii .
my husband has an xbox now but i can ' t play mario as it ' s only at an arcade or the nintendo game systems
i do enjoy going to dave and buster ##s - there aren ' t many arcade ##s around anymore due to the home game consoles .
now i have used the kin ##ect sensor for a few games that help with exercise , but it was more for the exercise than anything else .
because the breed of dog originated in wales .
not really , but one interesting thing is that there are two different types of co ##rg ##is .
well there are pembroke co ##rg ##is and card ##igan co ##rg ##is as well .
both forms of co ##rg ##is were bred to be herd ##ing dogs .
yeah i feel you there but i just really feel like i need a break before graduate school .
i ' m still so und ##ec ##ided , i don ' t even know if i want to go to a private or public university or a liberal arts college .
i think i agree with you on that one , maybe ohio state university
he was born june 30 , 1985
the breakdown is as follows : olympic gold medals in individual events ( 13 ) , and olympic medals in individual events ( 16 ) . all together that will be 23
my calculation is wrong , he has a total of 28 medals as i stated earlier
how does that help since reading process requires continuous practice , development , and ref ##ine ##ment .
well , i am not sure how that helps but anyway ##s reading requires creativity and critical analysis . so maybe that could be some therapy for it .
of course yes and even extensive reading which is a way of language learning , including foreign language learning , through large amounts of reading .
it is a good thing to learn a foreign language originally from another country .
yeah exactly ! they were one of the most popular registered dogs in the united kingdom .
they were actually from the 1800s when they crossed bulldogs and rat ##ters in paris .
i ' m not sure , but they were mixed with terri ##ers in order to reduce their size .
it can also be topped with ve ##gg ##ies and many different meat ##s . can also be made without cheese .
in 2009 italy had a request to make the neo ##pol ##itan pizza and to make it registered with the european union as a traditional dish .
there are independent stores and chains as well as cafes that serve pizza on their menu .
they are super healthy , but super yu ##cky in my opinion . in the middle 19th century , they used bee ##tro ##ot juice to color wine . i wonder how it affected the taste ?

honestly i ' ve been too busy to think about anything like that . ever since my husband died , i ' ve been spending so much time taking care of his old business . learning the ropes . maybe someday i ' ll be ready to find someone new .
with help and with self - reflection , i guess . widows are treated differently all around the world , i ' m lucky enough to live somewhere where there ' s a lot of support for people like me . wouldn ' t be able to do it without them .

he ' s an australian horror writer , even has a critic / editor role , and is a musician and occult ##ist , fun ##ni ##ly enough . one of his famous works is " gas ##light grotesque , " which is kind of a horror spin on sherlock holmes . he was the australian representative for the horror writers of america , so you know he ' s leg ##it .
i like stephen king because his works can be supernatural or non - supernatural . but i agree , sometimes i like horror fiction that kind of gets a little more metaphor ##ical , and takes a spin on the larger fears of society . that truly allows for some artistic freedom .
oddly enough , what always seems to be a fun read is finding european horror fiction from way back , as in ancient greeks and ancient romans . . things like greek mythology with prom ##eth ##eus , who was a titan , etc . . they have an interesting way of writing and presenting their fears .

oh yeah that game has been around for ages , i wasn ' t as into that one as a few people i know were .
only children are actually pretty uncommon throughout history .
although , from around the middle of the 20th century , birth rates actually fell and so did the average family size , mostly due to increasing costs of raising children .

no problem ! sorry you were so lonely growing up !

i like north american white ##tail deer . have you seen the new movie , " the legend of the white ##tail deer hunter " , with danny mcbride and josh bro ##lin ?

yeah , they should or at ##lea ##st a v6 which is more compact
well , simply put the v8 is just two inline - fours using the same crank ##shaft
yeah as crazy as it sounds and ##on each of their ends mounted
i prefer motorcycles as they feel more natural . mo ##ped ##s have pe ##das and a crank ##set
mo ##ped ##s for the sole reason that they are slower by design . also , ' mo ##ped ' was coined by hara ##lf nielsen ( swedish )
in 1952 : = )
personally , i like red .
it was actually based out of england and originally called " strictly come dancing " , it aired on the bbc over there .

yes , the dancers do their cho ##re ##graph ##ed routines for a panel of judges .
coke as in cocaine ? or coca cola drink ? some areas in england will actually serve wedding cake for breakfast . talk about an un ##hea ##lth ##y ha ##bb ##it .
well , if it was pablo es ##ca ##bar , then he might have had a wedding like that . today regular cake is usually served to guests and put on display .
ha ##ha , i don ' t know about that . usually cakes are made to give you good luck . anything secret ingredients might take grandmother by surprise .
they probably just have a bruised ego and a smaller wallet . they ' re usually just the center ##piece of the wedding , and sometimes not even served to the guests .
unfortunately , they suffer in so many ways from being left to die from owners who decided they didn ' t want them , cruelty and torture of animals or neglect by not feeding or caring for them , and also we help rescue animals in emergency situations . we also do a lot for people .
its worth it . after all , we should have compassion on animals because they are under our care as humans . its important to make sure they aren ' t killed just for their fur or other body parts . also , so many companies use cruel methods to slaughter animals .
in 1970 they did pass a term called spec ##ie ##ism that make sure to treat all animal species with protection and respect .
it seem it derived most directly from the ry ##th ##m and blues music on the 1940s . do you like any particular singer ?

they say cost ##co is the second largest retailer but i ' ve never been ! i like the little personal pizza ##s . so good . i ' m hungry now

really ? some countries call it local government councils
some local government areas have been granted city status on the basis of population
that is cool . some urban areas in australia are governed mostly by city council
cool . some significant urban areas can be under rural local gov ##er ##ments
also the name is derived from a venue which includes stadiums with a track . but honestly that is if the school or place can afford a track .
i know of jackie joy ##ner ke ##rse ##y and carl lewis , and usa ##in bolt . these people participate in a variety of different track and field events .
he ' s the fastest guy in the world . some of the events include discus throwing , javelin throwing , triple jump , and high jump

coco chan ##el ' s first perfume is something you ' ve probably heard of : 5 .
5 was actually developed by a french - russian chemist called ernest beaux .
the 1920s . it was meant to ep ##ito ##mi ##ze the flap ##per culture and liberated spirit of the times .
its interesting that if james cameron didn ##t have such an interest in ship wreck ##s we might not have gotten this masterpiece .
at the time it had the highest budget ever of over $ 200 million but considering it made over 2 billion means he probably made a ridiculous amount .
ye ##a highest grossing box office till james cameron ##s next big hit , avatar which made 2 . 7 billion , guy is great at making the biggest bucks off movies .
it varies with species of spiders . there are over 45 , 700 spider species .
tara ##nt ##ula ##s are popular pet spiders . spiders also do not have antennae , unlike insects .
they eat all types of stuff . they live in almost every habitat except air and water .
no problem . spiders also rank seventh in diversity in total species among every organism . im happy none of those can fly .
different parenting styles can really pay a role on it . it ' s more psychological than anything .
ye ##a , kids have fragile little minds , parenting styles heavily influence they way they turn out to be .
it ' s pretty neat be ##cu ##ase the quality of your parenting can actually be much more essential that the actual amount of time you spend with your kid .
that people aren ##t perfect so don ##t expect to be a perfect parent .
it ' s a team based multiplayer online first - person shooter video game .
yes . the game assigns players into 2 teams of 6 . each person can select a different character that has their own unique style of play .
i ' m not sure exactly , it depends . . but the players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map .
oh , it ' s hard to choose , there are so many varieties , especially because you can add fruit and candy
well , the earliest extant description of what is now often called a cup ##cake was in 1796 , and it ' s sounded delicious !
oh well , before the invention of mu ##ffin tin ##s , they were often baked in individual pottery cups , ram ##eki ##ns , or mold ##s , isn ' t that neat !
oh probably , but now we ' ve come so far with technology that we have them to be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup to make it easier !
i am just a big fan of all things water , such as snow , clouds , and especially fog
yes it is from nearby bodies of water and is really a low flying cloud
it can be . but without it , there would not be suit ##ible enough conditions for a lot of eco ##yst ##em ##s
and if we did not have enough water or rain , citrus fruit ( my favorite ) such as lemon ##s , orange ##s and others would not grown
yeah i love horses . they ' ve been domestic ##ated since 4000 bc and more in 3000 ##bc .
yeah there are sub species of this e ##qu ##us fe ##rus that were wild and descended from domestic ##ated horses .
i bet . it ' s crazy how horse racing has a long history across civilizations .
yeah the odd toe ##d un ##gul ##ate mammal is seen everywhere .
usually combined with hospitality venues like camps , hotels etc . nearby
beaches typically are in places along the coasts , so yes fl has a lot of them
anytime in fl , you can also find what is called wild beaches which are basically und ##is ##co ##vered beaches
i love it to , but i am in the same boat as you with the diet , so i have been experimenting with using different ingredients . i have found a few alternative sweet ##ener ##s that make it del ##ico ##us and low cal ##ori ##e . you should try it .
i use ste ##via . it is extracted from the leaves of a plant called ste ##via re ##bau ##dian ##a . it takes some getting used to but is worth it .
you can get ste ##via drops that are a liquid for and very concentrated . the only problem is some brands can have a bitter taste so you have to be careful not to ruin your cake .
you can use it just as you would any other sweet ##ner , but you would have to look up a conversion chart . one option is to use chocolate chips sweet ##ened with ste ##via instead of sugar too . lily ' s chocolate chips is a good brand !
the s nat ##ch and the clean jerk are the two competition lifts
yes and the body weight categories differ for males and females
not sure ? the clean press used to be a competition lift but it was stopped because its too difficult to judge
not really but each weight ##lift ##er gets three attempts to lift the weight
many of his songs are about violence and hardship in the inner city . it ' s really re ##lat ##able to a lot of people .
yes of course . his music is heavily influenced by ideals of the black panther party , because lots of his family members were black panthers .
no , not really . but i think they ' re interesting !
yes , i own some of them . do you ?
those who like to participate can those who do not know history do not have to , this is mainly done in the us , but other countries like the uk , germany and others also do these and they did not have the civil war
you know re ##ena ##ct ##ments of the ci ##ci ##l war actually began before the real battle had even ended
there are re ##ena ##ct ##ments of all of the wars , the civil war being most popular because it was fought on us soil , and it was us against us , the biggest popularity came between the 80 ' s and 90 ' s
i have been once , not really into that but a lot of the rein ##act ##ors were dec ##end ##ants of those who actually fought , years ago the actual veterans would re ##ena ##ct to honor they fallen comrades
you can get ta ##cos with any topping ##s on corn or flour tor ##till ##as soft or hard , its great . i like shrimp ta ##cos for example
they are a very old mexican dish and since they are cheap and simple they are eaten quite often
ta ##cos were brought over like anything , people moved here and showed others how to make them , they are easy to eat and delicious so they caught on
ta ##cos on soft corn tor ##till ##as are the most authentic and taste the best im ##o
i had to look it up , i always wondered what the term actually meant .
i rode a horse when i was a kid once , it was a guided tour on a ranch . i only road for tourism reasons . have you ever ridden a horse ?
i agree , personally i am a bigger fan of recreational riding compared to horse racing . do you bet on horse races ?
yeah ! me too ! i love to follow mario ' s adventures in the fictional mushroom kingdom . it ' s really a classic .
i know right ? some people think of video games as an art form . other people disagree with that . what do you think ?
for sure ! i like how many different platforms you can use . people game on computers all the way down to small handheld devices .
wow ! that ' s the old 8 bit computer sold by commodore business machines ? was that before or after the commodore 64 ?
i always use ic ##ing and other cake decorations like fruit and sp ##rin ##kle ##s . cream cheese is also delicious .
gee , it completely depends on the ingredients and who makes them . the english fairy cakes vary in size a lot . the american cup cake is more of a standard size .
totally . years ago before mu ##ffin tin ##s were invented the cup cakes were made in little individual pottery cups . today you cake even ba ##ke a little cake in a coffee mug in the microwave !
exactly , and back in the early 19th century they had two different terms to describe different varieties . one was a " cup cake " and the other a " cup ##cake " .
that ' s crazy the odds of both us meeting must be really low ! apparently it ' s more common in people with northern or western european ancestry ( 2 - 6 % ) .
well that certainly makes sense then ! what kind of hue is your hair ? mine is kind of a bright copper hue .
there ' s probably a way to change it , though i don ' t know if it would be good for your hair . some people even have strawberry blond red - hair , the variation is crazy .
i think gray hairs are something to be proud of personally , i ' ve had some even since i was like 16 , which seems to def ##y their normal pattern .
the mountains and the forest i heard is so great to see and tour just to be in a peaceful environment i can ' t wait .
yes i looked and toronto and montreal is great to stay so it will be between those 2 cities may go with toronto since drake is from there lo ##l .
lo ##l no you never heard of drake he is one of the top musician right now he is a canadian rapper and songwriter .
i haven ' t looked that much into the train ride where do it takes you maybe we can get on the train on our way to the mountains or forest .
sure , there ' s songs about love , or about political or social themes .
sure , it started in the 1940s and 1950s , and came into its own in the 1960s .
i really love bon jo ##vi . slippery when wet is a great album .
give the album " lost highway " a try , too !
awesome ! what is your favorite flavor of pie ?
yes ! do you prefer a filled pie , where the crust is only on the bottom , or a two crust pie , where the crust is also on top ?
i prefer the filled kind too , otherwise there is too much crust . also , there is a kind called top crust , where the filling is only on the bottom and the crust is only on top ?
yeah the crust on top seems like a mess , so i have never made one like that . i think my favorite pie to make is apple .
after the apples are cut it is a breeze ! i like apple pie ##s because you can make patterns by stack ##ing the apples and layer ##ing with crust !
another thing i like about it is depending on what you have on hand you can use brown sugar , sugar syrup , mo ##lass ##es , maple syrup , or honey .
i find it interesting that some people add chocolate and / or bourbon in some versions . not sure how i would like that
very true , obviously the native americans knew pe ##cans were good . in texas they found evidence of pe ##cans being used 800 ##0 years ago .
they usually serve in bro ##th or pasta sauce in italian cuisine
pizza is favorite food for me too it is delicious and italian food too
but it is somewhat good it offers an abundance taste and most popular food too
i have two cats . pets provide both physical and emotional benefits
some of the most popular pets are dogs and cats but also believe it or not pigs
yes , my uncle has a small pig as a pet , they don ' t really grow , they stay pretty small . i used to have chin ##chi ##llas and parrot ##s
do you mean lo ##l is color blue too . i am sure it is as most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors
i know . i am just teasing you . lo ##l was was first used almost exclusively on use ##net but has since become widespread in other forms of computer - mediated communication and even face - to - face communication .
oh yes . i know and blue is an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times . maybe because it lifts your mood .

i ' m not sure specifically , but he was also a co ##smo ##logist and researched at the university of cambridge .
stephen hawk ##ing was famous for his work in co ##smo ##logy and physics .
he died very recently and was born on january 8 1942 .
yeah , there are over 6 , 000 species of lizards too .
the only places that they don ' t inhabit are most oceanic island chains .
pretty much , though they don ' t inhabit antarctica either . lizards are versatile i guess .
i bet it is . it ' s strange that bro ##cco ##li did not become widely popular until the 1920s .
bro ##cco ##li was first introduced to the us by southern italian immigrants .
really , i didn ' t know that . i also remembered that italians have considered bro ##cco ##li to be highly valuable food since the roman empire .
well , considering rome was the largest city in the world bc , i would imagine it was .
i think she ' s pretty impressive at just 16 she dropped her first album .
it was called taylor swift . do you like any of her songs ?
oh ok i ' m not really sure i have heard that before .
nice ! that sounds interesting . using technology for art is bound to happen in this day and age
that ' s awesome ! i like to play nintendo games like mario . i ' ve also played ze ##lda !
i ' m bad at that too . i go for the more adventure games or time - wasting games lo ##l
i used to play that all the time ! ! that was my jam . it ' s been so successful all over the world !
i would think that home computers would be where its at money wise . home computers are super affordable these days .
that also surprises me . i can see tablets being used and bought more frequently , but not phones . i enjoy the graphics on a computer .
do you also expand memory in your job ?

the laws do seem to vary around the world but most countries do require the san ##ction of the courts to help resolve a lot of the issues that come up .

i wonder if we do as well
its a genre of music that was started by african americans in the deep south . you should really check it out but its not for everyone . jazz is a bit more easy listening .
its not too old but the jazz age was in the 1920 ' s . that ' s when it really started to be seen as a big form of musical expression . i would start with some smooth jazz to get used to it . its easy listening .
his music does have some jazz elements and is definitely easy listening but he ' s really just a saxophonist more than anything else . but the saxophone is definitely part of jazz ! so see , you like a form of jazz . you are just missing the blues .
ha ha . i am kind of with you on that . he ' s not my thing . you might like more of what i like which is jazz fusion . its like funk , rock , rhythm and blues , and latin jazz all mixed together . its funky and fun with an edge !
it was often used by roman generals to celebrate victory . do you have a favorite color ?
forest green ? the red you see in geology for example , the grand canyon , comes from iron oxide .
the planet mars is red because of iron oxide as well . straw ##berries and apples are red because of ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##ns .
nice . . yeah i prefer natural hair colors . i usually associate gray and white with age .
that is interesting . there was a study that was done in copenhagen that showed 18 % of men dye their hair .
i would also add that it is a huge industry . in the u . s > home coloring revenue reached 1 . 9 billion
i have been doing it as an entertainment style for 15 years now .
yes i do , modern clown ##s like me are strongly encouraged to use fancy clothes and make up to become more colorful .
ha ! many circus clown ##s have become well known as creepy monsters that lu ##rk in gut ##ter drains because of that movie

yes , this first store opened in 1962 .
how about dump ##lings i love homemade dump ##lings with chicken , potatoes and fresh vegetables .
i totally agree some people like theirs fried i prefer mines in a creamy sauce boiling , sim ##mering and steaming to get all the flavors lo ##l .
i have once at this restaurant they just add bank ##u and ken ##key and roll the dough into little balls and deep fry them .
ken ##key is from ghana it is made from a ground corn it is served with foods like fish , soup or stew .
because they are fra ##tern ##al twins , their resemblance is no more or less than sibling . however , they have a great bond .
i think their bond is probably similar . their behavior and manner ##isms are very alike . studies have shown this to be true as well .
that ' s a great question . i don ' t think so ! i just read that in n . america , the rate of a twin birth is 9 - 16 twin sets per 1 , 000 births . that seems like a lot !
his music career began in 1992
snoop dog was discovered by dr . dr ##e
yeah . snoop ' s debut album was released in 1993 by dr . dr ##e
selling almost a million op ##ies was sold
the condition of not having effects from alcohol . it is the state of being sober .
i read that it is natural state of a human being given at a birth . i do not quite agree with that statement .
do you agree with the statement " the natural state of a human being given at a birth " ?
was the person you mentioned earlier is considered sober now ?
oh yes i get you now . 7 is a lucky number with slots and various cas ##io gambling machines with the reel ##s . have you ever had a big win ?
i am not sure . though i know it has some history . the original hindus wrote it was a singular stroke then modern arabs changed the form to the distinctive shape it is today .
true and there are seven days , seven continents and seven bride ##s for seven brothers , god rested on the seventh day . . . lots of things . the seven wonders is a good point though the seven most important wonders of the ancient world , remarkable constructions .
enzo ferrari was the founder and he built his first car in 1940 .
in 2014 ferrari was rated as the world ' s most powerful brand ! i mean who wouldn ' t want a ferrari to drive around in ? lo ##l
i am not so sure about his life . i only know of his accomplishments . can you believe that in 1962 the ferrari 250 gt ##o became the most expensive car in history . what an accomplishment !
i am not sure because it was sold in a private transaction to craig mcc ##aw .
yep i really like it ! it comes from blues and rag ##time music .
really ! it originates from african - american communities in new orleans .
no i haven ' t but new orleans surely has changed a lot since the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
ha ##ha ! yeah , pink and green are a bit too crazy for me ! if you don ' t mind me asking , is your wife european ? i hear brown hair is pretty common there .
that ' s pretty cool , i didn ' t know you could use hen ##na to dye hair . i always thought hen ##na was for drawing designs on your hands .
that ' s pretty cool ! i ' ve heard there ' s all sorts of shades of brown hair . does she have light brown or darker brown hair ?
wo ##ah , that sounds really unique ! so is she considered a brunette ?
me too , i love the fine ridges that go down their length , sometimes spiral ##ing around the tube . it makes me so hungry just thinking about it .
pasta is actually a staple of italy and is a true food of traditional italian cuisine , it originated way back in 115 ##4 in sicily if i ' m not mistaken .
not sure but in italy the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary but after about 100 years after it was invented it was eventually brought to the us . i am not sure on the exact date .
my personal favorite is ling ##uin ##e , you really can ##t go wrong with it , just top it off with some tomato sauce and ore ##gano and you got a good dinner .
well it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression since the 1920s
i cannot think of any , but there are many distinctive jazz styles all over and from different cultures .
its roots are in west african culture .
its roots include african - american music traditions including blues and rag ##time
ferrari has multiple cars . . . they have f1 race cars , super ##cars , and hyper cars . they are a brand . what races do you watch from ferrari ?
yu ##p , though you referred " the ferrari " is solely race cars for formula one that is the highest class of single seating auto racing .
yu ##p ! ferrari was rated in 2014 as the most powerful brand by brand finance ! its a iconic logo and car for most people in the world . what is your favorite brand of car ?
hey nothing wrong with that ! i drive a pri ##us , gave up on my in ##fin ##iti and bmw a long time ago when the branding of the car caused them to be broken into multiple times . toyota is known for their hybrid cars and their reliability of all theirs cars !
i did not know that , is that when you don ' t eat any meat like chicken or steak ?
i understand . i like red sky at sunset . it comes from ray ##leigh scattering .
yes that is used for weather forecast ##ing during the past two millennia . it actually really works too .
well that is hard to determine because original showers were neither indoor structures of man - made , they were actually formed by natural things in nature such as waterfalls .
the ancient greeks were actually the first people to take showers , but the date is unknown .
yes , they used to take baths in basins , but found out that showers were a lot more e ##ffi ##cent
black hair is a dominant trait and is found in people of all ethnic ##ities
in english black hair is described as raven black or jet black
skin colors associated with black hair range from pale to dark skin
i know that it is before 8 and after 6 !
maybe it was the famous aus ##tra ##ilia ##n rugby is david camp ##ese
that ' s very true . another interesting fact about the australian rugby team is that they first played in sydney in 1899 .
yeah rugby actually started in aus ##tra ##ill ##ia as far back as 1864 .
pasta is divided in two categories . dried pasta ( sec ##ca ) and fresh ( pasta fr ##es ##ca .
dried pasta is known to be commercially produced that goes through an ex ##tr ##usion process ##th ##ough it can be produced in a home .

he was discovered by dr . dr ##e , and as a result he was featured on dr ##e ' s solo debut , " deep cover
he started his music career began in 1992
his album dogg ##y style has al ##ot of fine songs
it can be , this is a list of types of art and the materials used
it is ! in the art and science of architecture , the design and construction of buildings and interiors
i think this one greek guy did and got famous for it . it can involve multiple disciplines of brick ##work , carp ##ent ##ry , engineering , stone ##mas ##on ##ry
i have heard the art of carp ##ent ##ry and wood ##working is practiced by a skilled and proficient crafts ##person or join ##er
did you have it done professionally by a hair ##dre ##sser or yourself ?
yu ##p doing it independently at home probably save a lot time and money .
nice ! sadly my hair hair is thick and shaggy like a horse ' s mane so i can ##t dye them
did you b ##lea ##ch it to make it blonde ?
yes it can damage hair , it is so interesting 75 % of women in some cities like copenhagen use hair dye
yes it is , and there is huge money spent on it , like $ 1 . 9 billion in 2011
yes it is , but when it is done professionally by hair ##dre ##sser it can damage less
ye ##a a more formal ##ized method ##ol ##y has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards
well there is white wine which is a wine whose colour can be straw - yellow , yellow - green or even yellow - gold
rose might be the oldest known type of win , as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method
the hindus use to write the number 7 as a curved stroke that looked like an inverted upper ##case j .
it really is , and how it is different in other languages . eastern arabs made the 7 from a 6 . it kinda looks like an upper ##case v .
it is a central semitic language that actually developed during the iron age .
i really love baking and cooking up cakes and bread .
same , but it takes a lot of heat and like hot ashes or stones .
definitely , things like hot ashes and stones can cook it and kill bacteria .
oh yeah , that ' s why you cook things at such hot temperatures on these stones and ashes .
well , italy , with around 61 million inhabitants and being the fourth mo ##s populous eu member state they sure have a lot o chefs and a lot of di ##fer ##ent rec ##ip ##ies !
yes i was there in 2013 and being there i was able to try fresh pasta ! the one that we usually we ##at its dried pasta those are the two categories they have
it does ! everything about the italian cuisine offers an abundance of taste ##m no wonder it is one of the most popular and copied in the world , but nothing like the original
yes ! i really love pizza too ! when i was in india i just realized there were not too many pi ##zz ##eria ##s and learn that pizza is an emerging fast food in indian urban areas
over ##ea ##ting so much food is because they aim stuff at children , tis really terrible
over ##ea ##ting is something that needs to be controlled and stop kids from eating so much food
ye ##a over ##ea ##ting was being tackled by obama and michelle to stop too much eating
sometimes it is cause of eating disorders so you have to be careful of that too
i love its long and thin shape of spaghetti .
true . pasta has influenced cuisine ##s in the united states .
i do since i need to avoid products containing g ##lu ##ten .
yes ! maybe you can enjoy an alternative type like pasta ##s made from rice flour ? it ' s pretty good and has more protein .
there ' s a lot definitely ! it depends on the region where its made , with different shapes and types being popular to a specific region .
me too ! there are 310 specific ##s shapes of pasta with over 1300 different names documented . it ' s quite amazing !
ha ##ha yeah . to give and example , the shape " ca ##vate ##lli " has 28 known names , depending on where it ' s made .
fresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand , sometimes with the aid of simple machines
yeah ! spa ##get ##ti is a long , thin , solid , cylindrical pasta
significant changes occurred with the discovery of the new world and the introduction of potatoes , tomatoes , bell peppers , maize and sugar bee ##t
both dried and fresh pasta come in a number of shapes and varieties , with 310 specific forms known var ##ia ##bly by over 1300 names
black hair is the most common .
red hair is somewhere between one and two percent of all humans .
interesting ! that makes sense because red hair is actually due to a mutation in the mc ##1 ##r protein that may be associated with others .
that protein is on chromosome 16 and strictly for hair color , but associated with others , probably including an ##esthesia .
yes , especially the ones made with onions .
yes , but it has to clean , culture ##d meat .
the only kind of pasta i like with meat ##balls is spaghetti , but this is an american dish .
it can vary but it ' s approximately 625 - 740 nano ##meter ##s n width . it ' s very wide !
yeah , it ' s cy ##an ' s complementary color too , which happens to be a favorite shade of blue of mine .
i know much about color theory , which runs along the same principles . as it happens , it was leonardo da vinci ' s notebook ##s that were found in 149 ##0 that first sparked the controversy of the field .
all of the colors on the visible spectrum coincide with a wheel of colors , the main groups being primary , secondary and tertiary . which colors to use in art is important for setting the mood !
i know that is how i felt , you never know what happens when nan ##nies , baby ##sit ##ters , teachers or other providers are taking care of your children
i would definitely be more inclined to go that route when choosing the perfect care give ##r for my kids . i would feel even better using an extended family member of my child
very true , that is why i think it is best when parents or or legal guardians take care of their children , because they are they only ones that love the children
that is difficult and if you don ' t have resources for a quality day ##care , it can really impact children ' s futures . i think people really disregard how important development is for young children
the three waterfalls are the horseshoe falls , the american falls and the br ##idal veil falls .
i think that the br ##idal falls is the most beautiful of them all .
a lot of people get married there as it is a great place for wedding pictures and honeymoon ##s .
yes it would make a very memorable trip for sure !
is your hair a natural brown hair , or do you color it ?
that may be very appealing . brunette ##s are pretty as well . lots of french girls wear pi ##xie hair ##cut ##s and their hair is a brown : )
brown hair is appealing , but you should always satisfy yourself and not others . black is a pretty color as well
brown hair can look great on older people as well . i always thought that light colored hair shows the grey more .
i don ' t but it is important to understand now . early child care is equally important and often overlooked in child development .
that ' s so true . and day ##care is typically an ongoing service during specific time periods like when you need to work .
that ' s true . day cares are even all around the world in places like the united kingdom and new zealand .
that ' s awesome ! i ' m a trumpet player . it makes sense that it ' s so relaxing , its considered by a lot of people to be america ' s classical music .
plus its very cultural . it has roots in west african culture , as well as european military culture as well .
for sure ! i bet you didn ' t know it started in new orleans in the late 19th century !
you ' re so culture ##d yourself ! but since starting in new orleans , it spread around the world and developed into many different styles .
yes jazz developed from roots of blues and rag ##time
many say that jazz is america ' s classical music
since the jazz age of the 19 ##ma ##jo ##r form of music ##20 ' s jazz has been recognized as a
is yours biological or genetic ? i guess not a lot is understood about it .
diagnosis is commonly based on a person symptoms . what was yours ?
are you on medication such as ri ##nta ##to ##lim ##od ?
i think the fda has insufficient evidence to approve the use of ri ##nta ##to ##lim ##od in the us though .
i don ' t know . i think he probably was . he just has that persona about him . his real name is calvin cord ##oza ##r broad ##us , jr . ! not much of a gangster name !
i thought so too ! calvin jr . ! his got his start in music after being discovered by dr . dr ##e in 1992 . that ' s how he was able to make an appearance on dr ##e ' s album , the chronic .
i think he became a little too mainstream . have you ever heard his song , murder was the case ? it ' s one of my favorites that was never very popular . it was part of a soundtrack for a short film .
yeah , they were really fast & furious . . . lo ##l . ferrari in 1939 out of alfa romeo ' s race division as " auto av ##io cost ##ru ##zio ##ni " , the company built its first car in 1940 .
ferrari was rated the world ' s most powerful brand by brand finance . in the year 2014
lo ##l ! in may 2012 the 1962 ferrari 250 gt ##o became the most expensive car in history ,
from largest to smallest , the three waterfalls are the horseshoe falls , the american falls
firstly , horseshoe falls lies on the border of the united states and canada with the american falls entirely on the united states
interesting ##ly , at peak daytime tourist hours , more than six million cubic feet ( 168 , 000 m ) of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute .
speaking of the color red , it is iron oxide that gives the red color to the planet mars
also our blood being colored red comes from the protein hem ##og ##lo ##bin
yes , and important even in china where it is used to color lots of early pottery pieces
it ' s very old , going all the way back to the middle ages . the first recorded mention of it is from 118 ##4 .
indeed , the price of go ##uda has been disputed a long time . in the middle ages , buyers negotiated price with a system called " hand ##je ##kla ##p , " which involved clapping hands and shouting prices .
that would make shopping more fun . we ' re a long way from the time when all the cheese ##s would be brought to the market square to sell .
yes , me too . i ' ve loved going to norwich market in norwich here in england .
ah , cake boss , that guy make us all wanna be like him : ) but all over the world , i realize that the most commonly baked item is bread
oh well , bread is bread . let me tell you the process heat is transfer ##ed to surface of dough and it gradually moves to the center and other parts before you say jack , bread is ready .
to be honest , im not sure but i can tell you that making bread or baking is not different from bar ##be ##cu ##ing
at least nowadays , dog biscuits tend to be hard and dry , manufacturers claim that is to keep dog teeth clean .
chewing dry hat ##d thing can clean the teeth somehow . dog bis ##cuit usually are sold in a flat bone shape .
it varies , but those mentioned since forever were usually made from bran .
the truth is that a dog bis ##cuit is the equivalent of a human snack
ah ##hh i am not snoop . . . lo ##l i am talking about snoop dogg ! he is a music artist and performer that came out in 1992 with dr . dr ##e on deep cover and the chronic
he is an alright actor , not the best lo ##l but he did sell 23 million records in us and 35 around the world
back in my earlier days maybe but not now . you heard of " gin & juice " ?
lo ##l that was a song of his . it was on album called " dogg ##yst ##yle " became certified 4 ##× platinum in 1994 .
not bad for a guy who got 14 top 10 singles on the " billboard " hot 100 .
well wood ##working is the art of building buildings , furniture ##s and other objects .
i haven ' t but i have tried pottery . it is the art of making earth ##en ##ware , stone ##ware and sculpture .
yeah and then the clay is colored and fired in a ki ##ln .
well architecture is an art and science of constructing buildings and inter ##io ##irs .
i think i like that really we are the child ##s first teachers
just getting them in the groove of how things operate , this age is of ##ter overlooked in the developmental process of child rear ##ing
it is a da ##unt ##ing task being responsible for the care and supervision of a baby
i think i might want a diablo ! it was founded by enzo ferrari in 1939 out of alfa romeo ' s race division as " auto av ##io cost ##ru ##zio ##ni "
i don ##t think it is a ton since the are so expensive ! but in 2014 , ferrari was rated the world ' s most powerful brand in the world
im not sure about wealth but i know fiat s . p . a . acquired 50 % of ferrari in 1969 !
well long hair is usually rated as attractive by both men and women .
that ' s true ! apparently blond is cause by low level of the substance eu ##mel ##ani ##n .
the other substance that changes hair color is ph ##eo ##mel ##ani ##n .
ye ##a calvin cord ##oza ##r broad ##us isn ##t as catch ##y as snoop dog
snoop dog is very famous as a singer actor and rapper
he ##s famous for smoking weed and being a rapper , love snoop dog
me too , brown hair is most common after black hair
me too , its strands are actual ##le thicker than those of fair hair except those that have red hair
i did too and regretted it . hair color is pi ##rm ##entation due to 2 types of mel ##ani ##n
i don ' t know your situation but obesity is most commonly caused by ex ##ess ##ive food intake , lack of physical activity and even genetic su ##sc ##ept ##ibility
it ' s more common than you think . i feel like food is so comforting ! i strongly advice you to see a professional and start losing weight because obesity increases the likelihood of type 2 diabetes , sleep ap ##nea even certain types of cancers
changes to diet ( maybe not eating a lot of junk food and sweets ) and exercising are main treatments
you can do it ! i believe in you ! junk food is nothing but sugar , fat and extra cal ##ories . we don ' t need that
not much information on that but it is one of the most popular cheese ' s world wide .
the first mention of go ##uda cheese dates from 118 ##4 making it the oldest recorded cheese ##s in history . . very interesting i honestly had no idea
you ' re very welcome . . another fact is that its named after the dutch city of go ##uda
is there a good place i should take a picture from ?
i do enjoy a bit of gambling . i like playing crap ##s and the slots . how about you ?
i ' d love to go to vegas ! i ' d hit the penny slots and try to get free drinks all night . i go to atlantic city quite often . have you ever been ?
yes sadly it ' s very true . several casinos have shut down and it ' s not as busy as it once was . the casinos that are still open are nice though and the hard rock casino is about to open there too
sarah vaughan was great in from 1924 - 1990
wow awesome , she has been said to have " one of the most won ##dro ##us voices of the 20th century "
i wish i grew up in the jazz age in the 1920s when it became known as a major form of musical expression
i know they are found in sub tropical and tropical waters and they look scary
they are listed as endangered by international union for conservation of nature
they are threatened by pollution , getting caught in fish ##nets and chinese harvesting them for medicine
they have a slow reproductive rate and that makes it harder
heat is gradually transferred " from the surface of cakes , cookies , and bread ##s to their center , if you get it wrong it will burn
baking can be combined with grill ##ing to produce a hybrid barbecue variant have you tried it ?
baking is related to bar ##be ##cu ##ing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit
thank you ! it was extremely difficult at the beginning , but during treatment your goal is independence from consuming alcohol
the most important thing for me was the support of my friends and family - they would not drink either when i was around , which suppressed the temptation ! the aa meetings were very useful too
yes i have completed the whole twelve step programme , the most important one for me was step 8 , where i had to think of all of the people that i ' d hurt or affected whilst drinking
bread has to proof , or rise , before baking . the process is known as fe ##rm ##entation . beer fr ##oth helped this process .
well , you can ba ##ke sour ##dou ##gh bread , but it tastes almost as bad as that kim ##chi you mentioned !
ha ha somehow i knew we disagreed about the taste ! rye - based bread ##s use biological leave ##ning just like sour ##dou ##gh .
well it ' s origins are derived from the rhythm and blues music of the 1940s .
elvis presley is probably the most famous , surely you ' ve heard of him . he ' s the king of rock and roll
what would you like to know about him ? he was born in tu ##pel ##o , mississippi . perhaps you ' d like to know when his music carr ##eer started
oh , elvis aaron presley has many song , i can ' t name any off the top of my head , though
its next to orange on the spectrum and opposite of violet .
yes , there is a pale red pink out there .
if you are into sunset ##s , there is a red color that is caused by iron oxide .
iron oxide also gives the red color that mars has .
i ' m speaking in general terms , i hadn ' t really named one . the war of the words is good .
i suppose it ' s a sub - genre . the war of the worlds is a 2005 movie .
do you have a favorite comedy ? lots of humor sometimes in science fiction movies .
i ' ve never seen rush ##more . what is it about ?
it can also happen during festivals because people have built up so much anticipation to the event , and we even encourage over ##ea ##ting sometimes , for instance thanksgiving .
well i think the market for weight loss programs goes up during that time because they know people will be feeling bad about over ##ea ##ting probably , there ' s even 12 - step programs for over ##ea ##ters like over ##ea ##ters anonymous .
definitely , fortunately there are many beneficial the ##ra ##put ##ic ways to help stop over ##ea ##ting , like group therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for example .
it definitely can be hard because people are so attached to food sometimes , and there ' s also a large mental component to it like in bu ##lim ##ia or bing ##e eating disorder .
snoop dogg also has sold over 23 million albums since then . and that is just in the united states alone .
i remember i was about 12 when snoop dogg ' s album came out in 1993 . that album went platinum 4 times by 1994 .
i will still say his old school hits like gin & juice and what ' s my name . they still get played today .
ill still hear old snoop dogg on some . snoop dogg also helps produce , write songs , and has done some acting .
i do not know when it was first originated . i would assume a long time ago though ! i do know in the past baking was typically performed by women in the house .
bread ##s are the most common and important foods . both from an economic and cultural point of view . cake ' s and past ##ries are popular as well but bread is by far the most popular .
bread is normally prolonged in dry heat , typically in an oven . it can also be made in hot ashes or on hot stones .
they would typically use a fire pit or make a clay like stove . heat would be transferred from the surface to the bread ##s centre .
do you teach little kids roy g bi ##v ? what do you say when they ask what color indo ##go is ?
ok so one of the sentences says indigo is also called " ultra ##marine " ok ##kk ##kk ##k . . . . am i allowed to talk about another topic ?
i work in surgery , so i guess i like red because of the hem ##og ##lo ##bin in blood .
do you donate blood too ? it ' s always nice to donate such a necessary substance when you have excess but i don ' t ever weight enough to donate .
long time ago ! superman debuted in " action comics " # 1 in june 1938 )
do you prefer him by the name big blue boy scout or the man of steel ?
i agree , the origin story of superman relates that he was born ka ##l - el is the one that ##s most exciting .
various hindus wrote 7 more or less in one stroke as a curve that looks like an upper ##case j but vertically inverted .
more so , the western g ##hu ##bar arabs ' main contribution was to make the longer line diagonal rather than straight , though they showed some tendencies to making the character
as is the case with the european g ##ly ##ph , the cha ##m and khmer g ##ly ##ph for 7 also evolved to look like their g ##ly ##ph for 1 , though in a different way
you are welcome ! modern arab forms influenced the european form , a two - stroke character consisting of a horizontal upper line joined at its right to a line going down to the bottom corner , 7 also depicts some religious importance
no , i have never ridden one . but i do love riding bicycles . the motorcycle originally came from bicycles .
well i just have a street bike , but i would love to try mountain biking which focuses on off - road and rough terrain .
it does sound hard , but there is downhill mountain biking . you wouldn ' t have to pedal up ##hill , but there are jumps , drops , rock gardens and other things to contend with .
i prefer r & b style . funny enough , gospel music is one of the roots of r & b music . i guess i like the combination .
i think my favorite would have to be toni bra ##xton . i love her voice , her style , and most of her songs .
she used to be in a group with her family called " the bra ##xton ##s " in the 80s . they were pretty good , but i think she ' s better solo . she has put out albums somewhat recently .
i can ' t think of one i really like off the top of my head . every time i think about music i think about the pen ##tat ##oni ##x . not sure if they classify as r & b though . . .
yeah and pasta dates back to 115 ##4 in sicily
i love pasta and its commonly referred to as noodles
two categories of pasta are dried and fresh , i make mine fresh with the pasta machine
no not at all , and there are 310 specific shapes of pasta !
my bad ha ##ha . i think so too , red hair is not nearly as common as brown or black hair but i wish it was .
i better move there then ha ##ha . also brown hair can really vary in color for light to almost black .
me too ! my brown hair used to be blonde when i was younger .
i guess the pigment ##s in your hair can change , like the dark or light pigment ##s that determine the tone of your hair .
i don ' t really know , but it is hard to believe that the crocodile hunter has been dead for almost 11 years .
what is equally un ##bel ##ie ##ve is that he went from being the owner of a zoo in australia to being world renowned for his show , the crocodile hunter , which aired for 11 years .
his widow , ter ##i irwin is a remarkable woman . she met him at australia zoo and fell in love , and stood by his side through all of the tv shows and has continued his work since his death
the tv show , animal conservation , and running tr ##he zoo
it ' s been around for around 1000 years , with the first reference dating to 115 ##4 in sicily .
there ' s a large variety of pasta , with 210 specific forms known .
las ##ag ##na is my favorite . in italy the names of pasta vary by location .
baking bread is an ancient activity . i have only baked bread once as a 4 ##h project as a kid
do you ever put honey on it ? ancient roman baker ##s used honey and oil in their bread products . that sounds so delicious
how many different types of bread recipes have you made ? the ancient greeks baked hundreds of types of bread
oh , the color of blood comes from hem ##og ##lo ##bin , but straw ##berries and red apples are colored by ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##ns .
red pigment used to be made from och ##re and was also one of the first colors used in art .
then there is that saying , red sky at sunset about the grand canyon which is caused by hem ##ati ##te in geological and iron features .

well you can start by just walking 30 minutes a few times a week , and then build into some kind of physical exercise like swimming or weight training . i like weight training because i like seeing my muscles grow and i find it enjoyable .
i wouldn ' t call it any particular diet like ke ##to or low - fat really . i just stick to whole un ##pro ##ces ##sed foods and try to eat a good amount of leg ##ume ##s , nuts , fruits , vegetables , whole grains , and a bit of meat , eggs , dairy to fill the rest . i consider that to be " proper " nutrition .
it ' s important to find a balance in a healthy diet , i think a good way is to find nutrient - dense low cal ##ori ##e foods so you can eat bigger quantities and feel full while getting proper nutrients and not too many cal ##ories .
that ' s great , you ' re making the most important change i think someone can . to me a healthy diet is the most critical factor for one ' s overall health , you are what you eat after all .
you should work out quite often , but not every day - it ' ll boost the immune system and helps prevent things su ##sh as as corona ##ry heart disease , type 2 diabetes , and obesity .
you don ' t want to over work your muscles . and being fit is the quality or state of being fit .
strength training is good - can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well - being as well as improved cardiac function !
it does ! and weight training is also good to do because it targets specific muscle groups and types of movement .
i don ' t know many musicians by name , but i love it so much . it ' s seen as " america ' s classical music " .
not really , but i do know that jax ##x has been around since the 1920s .
well it was developed from the blues and rag ##time which was very popular back in the early 20th century so that is a big reason .
i love them all ! i can ' t pick just one ! the jazz age was in the 1920s and is now recognized as a major form of musical expression !
it originated in new orleans , specifically in the african - american communities
what sets jazz apart from other types of music is the swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , poly ##rh ##yt ##hm ##s and improvisation
earl fuller was an early jazz band ##leader - he ' s pretty famous !
speaking of roses , have you ever heard the guns n ' roses album " appetite for destruction " ?
it is ! it ' s a hard rock band from la , california that formed in 1985 .
axel rose is the lead singer
i am , i own all 6 of their studio albums and they ' re the 41st best dell ##ing band of all time

there are in modern times actually professional wine taste ##rs and they use a con ##sant ##antly ever evolving specialized type of terminology use to des ##ri ##be the wine an its char ##aca ##rist ##ics like flavors aroma ##s and char ##act ##istic ##s .
i do not because iv ##e only recently turned old enough to drink lo ##l . so while iv ##e had some im not much of a drink ##er unless someone else around me is . but interesting fact the aroma ##s of wine are actually more ##di ##verse than the flavors available !
yeah agreed . i love scents . but interesting ##ly white wine can be more than just white clear ##ish , it can be straw yellow , yellow - green , or yellow - gold .
yes it is . but what i also find inter ##sti ##ng is there have been resulting ##s contra ##dict ##ing the reliability off wine tasting in both experts and none ##x ##per ##ts , these results have surfaced through scientific blind wine tasting . results had inc ##ons ##iste ##ncy in identifying wines based on region in price , so while it may be an art it may not be a science .
i create all sort of software as long as long it is an ex ##ec ##utable code consisting of machine language instructions
it depends on how fast you can learn the languages such as co ##bol , c , c + + , c # , java , li ##sp , python , etc
i think i love co ##bol because i like working more on business , finance , and administrative systems for companies and governments .
it also crazy how its only in developed countries .
i think it has to do with food and lack of physical exercise .
exactly , that is why east asian countries use lower values obesity levels .
and it puts a drag on medical resources .
ferrari was founded in 1939 by enzo ferrari . their first car was finished in 1940 .
sure . in 2014 , brand finance name ferrari the most powerful brand in the world .
the 1962 ferrari 250 gt ##o became the most expensive car in history when it sold in 2012 . craig mcc ##aw from america bought it .
he was an american communications magnate . in 1969 fiat acquired 50 % of ferrari and now own 90 % .
i haven ##t seen their financial records but the target corporation is listed on the s & p index .
the target corporation was founded by george dayton . its headquarters are in minneapolis , minnesota .
im not entirely sure how many stores the target corporation has . the first one was opened in 1962 in rose ##ville , minnesota .
the target corporation really started to find its success in the cheap - chi ##c player in the the retail industry .
yes there is a history , but it ' s varied because of so many differences in costumes and performances .
my parents booked one for a birthday party when i was 9 and his style was creepy to me . it turned me off to it , but i think movies helped me acquire my fear of them .
i agree , despite my fear i respect and their trade . many circus clown ##s for instance have become well known key circus acts . i ' m certain that they are well paid .
yeah , i completely forgot about the animal acts at circus ##es and what kind of conditions they are subject to . that ' s unfortunate .
it is interesting that eu ##mel ##ani ##n and ph ##eo ##mal ##ani ##n are the two types of mel ##ani ##n that decide the hair color .
i believe it is due to the fact that mel ##ani ##n changes over time as a result the color can change slightly over time as well
again , that would be the change over time of the mel ##ani ##n at different levels of change . complete lack of mel ##ani ##n will result in white hair and slight level of mel ##ani ##n will result in gray hair .
that ' s right ! they ' re like human snack food , so we have to be careful we choose health ##ily , like we would for ourselves
that ' s true ! they look really cute when they ' re little bone shapes .
they can be good for dogs , too . some dog bis ##cuit makers say that they help clean dog ' s teeth
yes , she ' s a fra ##tern ##al twin , so they developed from two different eggs . but , still pretty cool .
i think every third generation on my mother ' s side . so , it ' s strange that in fra ##tern ##al twins , each has it ' s own sperm cell that is fe ##rti ##lized , and not one cell .
it does actually ! the yo ##ru ##ba people have the highest around the world . they have about 45 sets per 1000 births .
i saw " it " and i ' m pretty sure how i feel about clown ##s .
i haven ' t seen the remake yet . not brave enough . the clown from pol ##ter ##ge ##ist was pretty evil , too .
what was the name of the evil clown from american horror story ? that made it clear to me i was right to mist ##rus ##t them .
did you happen to see the killing joke ? that ' s an evil clown in that one . dc went way dark .
ye ##a pasta is a italian staple because it is so good and simple
also commonly used to refer to the variety of dishes
as an alternative for those wanting a different taste you can get rice pasta with no g ##lu ##ten
ye ##a i think it would be bad tho
i oddly spent some time learning about the number , because i like it too . eastern arabs developed 7 from a 6 look ##ali ##ke into an upper ##case v look ##ali ##ke .
both modern arab forms influenced the european form , a two - stroke character .
i can ' t be sure about how many cultures think of 7 as a lucky number , but christian denominations consider seven to be a holy number because genesis says that god rested on the 7th day and man was created on the 6th day .
well python is object oriented in the same way that c + + is . but my impression of python is that it is easier to use , but less efficient ( in use of computer resources ) to run .
python is actually very ve ##rs ##iti ##le as a high level language . i ' d call it more " powerful " than c + + , but it may not be a good choice when computing resources are at a premium .
they say that the last time bill gates wrote any code , it was on a tr ##s - 80 that he bought from radios ##ha ##ck .
that sounds like a good starting place . just keep gradually increasing the weight .
muscle growth should be faster if you increase the weight until muscle failure instead of rep ##s .
the weight training will increase your muscle and decrease your fat .
yes ! specifically i love swing and blues notes . frank sinatra and tony bennett are great .
yes ! he is one of the best selling jazz artists of all time . over 150 million records !
yes ! jazz is truly america ' s classical music . have any other favorite jazz singers .
well it has emerged as a form of independent and traditional music styles . it ' s linked by bonds between africans and european - americans .
ok , ferrari was founded by enzo ferrari in 1939
the first ferrari was built in 1940
ferrari plant in mara ##nell ##o , italy
i love olive garden especially the original one in orlando they opened in 1982 .
i believe so as well i would love to visit argentina that is where italian - born people reside great pasta i bet .
the taste is so full of an abundance of taste it just can ' t be copied lo ##l .
me and you both i will take dry pasta or fresh we will be broke .
yeah , i mean he sold over 23 million albums in the us alone . do you have any of them ?
bush ? is that an album ? i have " the dogg ##fat ##her " . i went double platinum in 1997 . that one had some awesome tracks !
for sure man . he ended up leaving death row records after that and joined no limit records . he put out 3 good albums after that .
what genre of music is that is that disco musical style ?
it seems like my generation is more into hip hop music also known as rap .
i know about the big hair lo ##l didn ' t know that was the 80 ' s i heard that was the style and it had to be full of volume .
main reason people color their hair is to cover grey or white hair
hair coloring is either done at home or at salon / professional
at home coloring is a ` 1 . 9 billion business
very nice friend ! ferrari was rated the world ' s most powerful brand recently . everyone knows the ferrari brand .
wow , i didn ' t know that ! it must be huge .
ah , that makes sense ! the most expensive car ever sold was a ferrari . it was a 1962 model , sold to craig mcc ##aw .
not sure how much . mcc ##aw is a pioneer in the cell phone industry , so i ' m sure he had no problem paying whatever it was . mountains of money !
today the definition includes proper nutrition and sufficient rest as well . i eat right , but i don ' t sleep !
well , your gym membership is good , because there is a relation between fitness and attractive ##ness that caused gym ##s to spring up in the last 30 years .
i haven ' t , because i thought it was olympic weightlifting ? i ' m more of a zu ##mba gal .
it is hard ! the squat ##s and lung ##es burn my legs !
yes , i love cookies ; probably a bit too much . i will usually just let a baker do the specialty bread ##s for me . but i like to ba ##ke cookies too . what are you favorite cookies to ba ##ke / ? or what varieties of cookies do you ba ##ke / ?
chocolate chip cookies actually originated in the united states around 1938 . a lady named ruth wakefield chopped up bits of a nest ##le chocolate bar into a cookie . thus , the chocolate chip cookie - which i love !
i agree . the only name i know of associated with cookies is the girl scouts ! lo ##l .
the 1962 ferrari 250 gt ##o was the most expensive car ever sold . it was sold privately in 2012 .
the first ferrari was built in 1940 . i would like to see a picture of that one .
ye ##a . ferrari has been own ##e by differ ##een ##t groups over the years so i am sure the looks have changes . the f ##ger ##rar ##i is now owned by a holding group in the netherlands .
i buy my dog , dog bis ##cuit . it is often sold in a flat bone - shape .
yes he does and it is a dietary supplement for dogs or other canine ##s , similar to human snack food .
yes i do especially when the dog bis ##cuit was criticized as particularly bad bread
yes of course . my dog health issue is a concern for me because infectious diseases that affect dogs are important not only from a veterinary stand ##point , but also because of the risk to public health
i remember when i was younger watching tr ##l and their number one music spot in nyc . did you ever get to go visit there ?
tr ##l used to be a show on mtv that actually showed music videos and did countdown ##s to the number 1 of the day .
are you a fan of mtv ? i remember when they actually used to play music videos instead of the series they have on it now .
music videos used to be really popular in the past . i don ##t think they are as popular as they used to be .
more yellowish . it was actually named that not because it was made in go ##uda , but primarily traded there .
it is in the province of south holland in the netherlands
whatever you like , really . a common one is topping on bread .
well if you want to get away from brown hair , why not try an unnatural color like cadet blue or purple ?
oh ! you could perhaps move away from europe and north america and move to , say japan where it is way less common . you ' d stand out more !
well , i don ' t know about that , but you would have a less common hair color without having to dye it some weird color .
i love italian cuisine i just love to have it full of vegetable bell peppers mushrooms and sugar bee ##t .
of course love it with meat ##balls have you ever tried yours with sugar bee ##ts it ' s sweet because it has high concentration but its delicious .
it is close in texture of sea bee ##t but once pulled from garden it looks a lot like a brown carrot lo ##l .
i prefer cooked unless you are on a raw diet it is easier to formula ##te .
it is natural , it is the second most common hair color .
it is second to black hair .
i like my hair cause it is light brown but sometimes it almost looks black .
i am in the usa . target established itself as the highest earning in the dayton - hudson division
yes . the target stores here in my area have great success and lots of cheap - chi ##c deals .
i think target is fun place to shop but oh my go ##sh there was a big publicized security breach of credit card data people were so mad
ye ##a its been a big part across many cultures due to it being the color of blood , it was used in maya ##ns and egyptians ceremonies , as well as by the romans .
actually red became a big color for costumes and outfits in the renaissance period among nobility and royalty .
compared to other colors like yellow and violet , they don ##t compare to red , only green and blue could compete which is why r ##gb is such a big thing .
oh yes , i enjoy it , it si seen by many as america ' s classical music
my favourite is the call and response vocals
me too , although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the black experience of the united states ,
wow , not really , intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as " one of america ' s original
yes ; there are many different shades f ##o red . my favourite is scarlet .
yes , there are lots of different shades of red . interesting ##ly , a shade is red mixed with black , and a tin ##t is red mixed with white - so pink could be a tin ##t of red .
yes ; i personally think of pink as it ' s own colour - it ' s been a colour name since the 17th century !
pink is a nice colour - it is associated with charm , sweetness and romance .
ko ##na in hawaii ! mana ##ta rays are large rays with triangular pe ##ctor ##al fins !
ye ##a it was a one of a time experience ! man ##tas are found in warm temperate waters as well as tropical

chinese celebrate the color color too

all sports ! it ' s achieved through proper nutrition , moderate - vigorous physical exercise , and sufficient rest .

spaghetti is great , you can make it with rice flour for people who avoid g ##lu ##ten
yes ! i use flour , egg , and water to form a dough , then flat ##ten it to make strips of pasta
yes , it ' s easiest to buy it already made . i usually buy dry pasta , which is called pasta sec ##ca in italian
al dent ##e means you cook the past so that it is still slightly firm , but not crunch ##y !
brown hair is characterized by higher levels of the dark pigment eu ##mel ##ani ##n and lower levels .
they are natural dye ##s natural dye ##s are vegetable dye ##s from plant sources — roots , berries , bark , leaves , and wood — and other biological sources .
sure , it would interest you to know that in china , dye ##ing with plants , bark ##s and insects has been traced back more than 5 , 000 years .
the french word for br ##une ##t " , which is a dim ##in ##utive form of " br ##un " meaning " brown / brown - haired " ? ,

it used to be yellow , but was changed to red to go along with the color - coding system used with railroads .
right , have you ever looked at mars ? the insane amount of iron oxide on it gives the red color to the planet , a lot of people thing its sand lo ##l .
a lot of others think that mars is the 6th planet from the sun lo ##l , it being the second - smallest planet in the solar system you would think they would remember that .
ik ##r its so weird to me how some people can be so une ##du ##cated , and don ##t get me started on flat earth ##ers , on boy . . .
yep ha ##ha , well on the topic of the color red , red pigment was actually made from och ##re was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art . that ##s why you see so many red paintings in caves , its not blood like people think .
i enjoy gothic fiction , which is largely known by the sub ##gen ##re of gothic horror , is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror or death
well something like horace wal ##pole would write such as the 1974 novel the castle of ot ##rant ##o - a gothic story
yes and horace is actually an english art historian , a man of letters and a anti ##qua ##rian
his books have been published by yale university press in 48 volumes
i think cookies are a good choice , just go with the basic ingredients like flour , sugar and some kinda oil .
that ##s not necessary , you only use the oil to mix with the dough , it makes the cookie less dry and gives it a nice smooth taste . also use it to prevent the cookies from sticking to the pan .
i never really thought of it , but that does sounds good just as long as you have su ##shi with the basics like brown or white rice . don ##t add any sauce ##s or it might clash with the taste of the cookies .
maybe just a bit , just make sure its finely gr ##ated before use , and dried up into powder in a large container or a paste also sounds good .
mmm , spaghetti with meat ##balls is excellent . and it ' s been said that immigrants in new york actually came up with it !
definitely . although it began in italy , pasta has had a tremendous influence on american cuisine .
yes , pizza is said to be invented in naples , italy , but america has developed their own styles , like ny style and chicago deep - dish .

i am going to check him out on you tube are you into country music i do like some good southern country music .
one feature of gospel music is dominant vocals with christian lyrics
exactly ! and most rely on hand clapping and foot st ##omp ##ing
gospel music got its start in the 17th century
ye ##a they were often repeated in call and response fashion
yeah i have heard that , funny . long ago 7 was written in a curve so it looked like a j .
that is just how they wrote . the western g ##hu ##bar arabs ' made it more diagonal than straight to kind of differentiate it .
the cha ##m and khmer g ##ly ##ph for 7 also made their number look like a one , but so different so they were not confused .
gospel is simply a form of the genre of christian music . some people get it , others don ' t .
gospel is classical . since the 17th century , when it arose , it has been based on the black tr ##adi ##ons of oral rec ##itation of music .
let me say this first : the difference between gospel and hymns is that hymns are sung in a call and response fashion , whereas gospel has one voice .
some of the famous gospel singers were george root , mahal ##ia jackson , and others .
i agree . it ' s important that a child receives quality child care from an early age , as it impacts their future , and they are our future .
yes , and i wished more parents , siblings and family played more of a role in child care , instead of passing off to strangers and the government .
true . it ' s very sad that throughout the world that it ' s fairly common for children to have children .
i do as well . many people want to give too much over to teacher ' s , and i realize they play a part , but it should never be too much of a role in my opinion .
i wouldn ' t imagine it is too difficult since bread is prepared from a dough of flour and water .
i bet your kitchen smells wonderful ! you could certainly call yourself a baker since you prepare all the yu ##mmy baked goods !
you could open a retail bakery or cafe for all the lovely baked goods .
i love 90s rap like snoop ##s first album . i don ##t listen to too many artists nowadays especially mainstream rappers .
i can ##t believe he ##s not as best selling as other artists . he ##s only sold 35 million albums around the world .
do you have a favorite song from snoop . mine is definitely gin and juice .
was that also produced by dr ##e ? i know gin and juice was .
i love spaghetti . it is a long , thin , cy ##lind ##ical form of pasta .
fe ##tt ##ucci ##na is a type of pasta popular in tu ##scan cousin ##e . the shape is flat ##ter than spaghetti .
pasta can be divided into dry and fresh pasta . water is added to dry pasta for cooking . my favorite type of pasta is las ##ag ##na .
fresh pasta was produced by hand but today it is available in most supermarkets . if you buy frozen pasta meals they have fresh pasta .
do you own a harley as i understand there are many owner clubs and events for owners .
what type sc ##oot ##er do you own ? as i understand it , a sc ##oot ##er is a type of motorcycle with a step - through frame .

very cool ! genuine sc ##oot ##ers markets sc ##oot ##ers in over 240 dealers in the usa !
no , i prefer star ##gate sg - 1

yes , the film ' s central plot explores it best characters
yes ! bread is always really good baked , what do you like to ba ##ke ?
neat ! i think baking cookies is great because the heat is gradually transferred to the centre of the cookie .
a long time i think ! the method of cooking used to be done entirely with hot stones or hot ashes !
yes ! have you ever tried combining grill ##ing and baking ?
yes it is . another cool fact is that the first car badge ##d with the logo was completed in 1947 .
i do believe that the max speed is 202 mph .
about 800 ##0 give or take a few .
it depends on the country and currency .
there are also two types of pasta : dried ( pasta sec ##ca ) and fresh ( pasta fr ##es ##ca ) .
definitely ! italian cuisine also influences several cuisine ##s around the world especially the u . s .
that is true , it was first referenced in sicily in 115 ##4 .
pasta can also be made with rice flour instead of wheat for people who want to avoid g ##lu ##ten .
the main reasons are cosmetic - to cover gray or to change to a more fashionable color - or even to correct b ##lea ##ching by the sun
at home coloring has reached 1 . 9 billion and is expected to rise in the us
i guess since it can be done by a hair ##dre ##sser or at home , that at home is a lot cheaper .
i don ' t think so . it was two high school students living in cleveland ohio .
the character was created in 1933 but didn ' t debut with dc comics until 1938 .
maybe in movies , but superman still is the top dog in american comic books . if anybody reads those anymore .
i do like sax music . i used to listen to a lot of kenny g back in the day . i believe i even had his album duo ##tones
can you believe that candy du ##lf ##er began playing at the age of six ?
yes , her band ' funky stuff ' she created just when she was 14 years old . quite a musical pro ##de ##gy
i was most impressed that her debut album received a grammy nomination as well .
my favorite comic book character from dc is batman !
i really do like batman movies . the dark knight is an all - time great . i haven ' t seen the new batman vs . superman movies though .
i only know that ben af ##fle ##ck is the new batman in batman vs . superman .
the name " conductor " is most used in north america . people in other areas of the world have other names for it . do you ever work internationally ?

do you usually work in the center of the train , where you have a good view of the whole platform ?
i like the fact that is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the united states during the late 1940s and early 1950s
the " godfather of soul " . james brown .
he was the pro ##gen ##itor of funk music and a major figure of 20th century popular music and dance
well there are two types . the first are identical , where they develop from the same z ##y ##go ##te . fra ##tern ##al twins develop from two separate eggs ! what type are your sisters ?
interesting ! they were both fe ##rti ##lized by a different sperm cell in this case . do you know much about human biology ?
of course ! sometimes there are non - related people who look very similar . these people are referred to as do ##ppel ##gang ##ers . do you have a do ##ppel ##gang ##er ?
interesting . i once had someone in my high school who looked very similar to me . i was visiting africa last summer and learned that 18 - 30 twin sets are born for every 1000 births !
honestly , i lost a bet lo ##l . hair coloring is the practice of changing hair into various colors , and i got stuck with that one . thanks friends
well , purple is an intermediate color between blue and red .
personally , i prefer green : ) interesting ##ly , at home coloring ( with those kits ) reached 1 . 9 billion dollars in the us in 2011 . talk about a lot of product
that ' s awesome ! what kind of goods do you ba ##ke ?
what makes g ##lu ##ten different from the regulars ? taste wise
how do you heat your oven ##s for your bakery ? do you go with old style wood or more electric ?
that makes sense . i can see that
the three waterfalls are the horseshoe falls , the american falls and the br ##idal veil falls . they are all cool to see .

they are located between canada and the us near new york .
niagara falls consists of exactly three falls .
i though that too but nah it is three waterfalls on the border of canada .
yeah , i ' d love to visit new york anyway without seeing niagara falls .
i agree with you ! sob ##riety is such a natural state of a human being given at birth
go ##sh that ' s so horrible ! my father used to be an alcoholic so i ' m pretty trauma ##tized , that ' s why i all for sob ##riety and i want everybody i care about to be sober
good for you ! stay sober , my friend ! because someone who abs ##tain ##s from alcohol but wants to start drinking again isn ' t truly sober
me too ! it began in 1970 , making it one of the oldest comic - con ##s .
that ' s hilarious . i ' d loved the television series , " myth ##bus ##ters "
i liked it when they tried to bust famous movie references , like is a martini actually better " shaken , not stirred "
it seems to build a cool community for the span of the convention . i know you can also listen to panels that have favorite tv characters , like from agents of s . h . i . e . l . d . , and the like .
that ##s great ! another fact about 7 is that hindus wrote 7 more or less in one stroke that looked like a j
yeah , another interesting fact is that the easter arabs developed the 7 from a 6 look ##ali ##ke the number looked like a capital v
not much information on when it became a thing . but i did find that both modern arab were influenced changing the character to the american way . so it must have been around for a long time
yeah , another fact is that for the khmer this involved adding a horizontal line above the g ##ly ##ph
probably all the exclusive ##s . the name , as given on its website , is comic - con international : san diego ; but it is commonly known simply as comic - con

im not sure it will be packed just look around . they do other shows wonder ##con , held in anaheim , and the alternative press expo
i had mono as a child , but if i understand correctly the cause of cf ##s is not completely understood .
i have not heard of that . i ' m assuming it relates to people missing life due to no cure .
it seems crazy that there are no medications or procedures that have been approved in the us for this .
there are many forms of techno now , but detroit was its origin ##ation .
in the us , classic rock is generally consider from the 1960s to the late 1980s
alice cooper with his ras ##py voice is considered to be the " godfather of shock rock "
coming from arizona , it is actually a full band with drummer neal smith
well fatigue is not due to st ##ren ##uous ongoing ex ##ert ##ion , it is not much re ##li ##ved by rest , and it is not due to a previous medical condition . it is une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d fatigue and severity of functional impairment
there is evidence that suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy and gradual increase in ac ##iti ##v ##ty suited to individual capacity can be beneficial in some cases
ye ##a you may want to talk to your doctor as evidence supports the use of the medication ri ##nta ##to ##lim ##od
well its only used in low dos ##ages as only low - strength doses show evidence that it can improve the ability to exercise .
do you have any special techniques to make sure the cakes and brown ##ies heat thoroughly ?
that ' s a good tip ! i could see that applying for other batter ##s and pizza dough to make sure the crust is crisp ##y and still is soft in the center .
baking is such an important skill for cooking , especially since bread is a common and nut ##rit ##ious food for many cultures .
i really love a good chocolate cake or chocolate chip cookie , with a homemade touch !
then yes : d , but i would do it at home , not at the hair ##dre ##sser ##s i would be ashamed : d
well i would probably not make it for a month and hide all the time , and after few days give a tip to my hair ##dre ##sser to come and fix the change : d
he ##he the reason why for me i would say that i did it because i want to be like lucifer from supernatural drama , if you have seen it
he is a blonde i think , but maybe he aged like that , maybe gray a bit i don ##t know , the actors name is mark pe ##lle ##grin ##o
the winters in the ku ##sh mountain range get very cold
have you seen the film lone survivor ?
yes it was a book first , about what happened to seal team 10
dr . dr ##e who ##s real name is andre rome ##lle young was born february 18 , 1965 , his stage name is dr . dr ##e , .
pretty big actually , he ' s actually sold over 23 million albums in the us alone and 35 million albums worldwide .
ha ##ha yes indeed , snoop dogg is also known as the weed king , because of his addiction to cannabis .
that ##s pretty neat , my favorite album from snoop dogg has to be dogg ##y style , which was released on november 23 , 1993 , .
so it focuses on multiple genres of entertainment , like movies and tv
it ' s all movies and it ' s a four day event that goes from thursday to sunday
well the wednesday prior they have a preview night that lets you walk the exhibit hall to see what they will show during the convention
of course yes they need to know if the person is sober or in a state of sob ##riety
well it is the state that everyone has experienced before because it is the natural state of a human being given at a birth .
of course yes . who should not like the achieved goal of independence from consuming alcohol .
it ' s one of the colors that ' s at the end of the visible spectrum of light , sitting right next to orange , and opposite of violet . its wavelength is dominant , with nano ##met ##res of 625 to 740 . so , it ' s obviously a strong color , which is why some people like it .
well , for example , you ' ll see red in the sky at times due to the ray ##leigh scattering , and you ' ll see red in the grand canyon and other geological features because of hem ##ati ##te or red och ##re , which come from iron oxide . these are just a couple of examples , but red is very present in nature .
another couple of interesting examples of red . . . one notable galactic example is mars , which is also red because of iron oxide . and then there ' s your own blood ! it ' s red from the hem ##og ##lo ##bin protein in it . ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##ns give the red color to straw ##berries , red apples , and red autumn leaves . . red is all around us , in little details of our lives .
production of alcoholic drinks is common and often reflects cultural and religious peculiar ##ities as much as geographical and sociological conditions .
its a big business . global alcoholic drink industry exceeded $ 1 trillion in 2014
yeah ! encompasses the liver manifestation ##s of alcohol over ##con ##sum ##ption , including fatty liver , alcoholic hepatitis , and chronic hepatitis with liver fi ##bro ##sis
oh yeah , i ' m not surprised . red and other colors are super influential . cops are more likely to pull over a car if it ' s red .
same actually . i have a dark red chevy cruz ##e and i worry sometimes because of it . i ' ve been lucky so far , knock on wood !
well , prehistoric art used och ##re , a reddish brown colored type of rock , so quite a long time ago .
yeah , like when metals get rusty . they can be yellow , deep orange , brown , all through that range .
i don ' t know where he was born , i know that by being born in 1971 he is over 45 years old .
his debut album was released 25 years ago , in 1993 .
his debut album was certified 4 x platinum in 1994 .
jazz is seen by many as american classics
jazz started since 1920
jazz has west african roots and musical ex ##pres ##ions
kenny g . . jazz has spread around the world
it is a primary color in the r ##gb color model and the cm ##yk color model , and is the complementary
reds range from the brilliant yellow - tinged scarlet and ve ##rmi ##lli ##on to blu ##ish - red crimson ,
red sky at sunset results from ray ##leigh scattering , while the red color of the grand canyon and other geological features is caused by hem ##ati ##te or red och ##re
it really does sound like a great time , as it is a sensory evaluation of the wine .
i know what you mean . also , wine tasting has been around since ancient times .
not really , since wine tasting has been around since the 14th century .
maybe in the creation of wine , but the romans did not start wine tasting .
that sounds really nice ! it makes sense that i like it since i like the blues and rag ##time and they ' re all very similar .
it ' s music that is characterized by it ' s " ragged " rhythm . jazz though is known as " america ' s classical music " , which is really cool to me .
good , jazz has been recognized as a major form of musical expression for so long . good to see you giving it the respect that it deserves .
i don ' t think they did , but by the 5th and 6th centuries the ancient greeks were using oven ##s . most communities had one large shared oven .
these enclosed oven ##s were heated by wood fires that were mainly for different types of bread .
in ancient rome a few centuries later the first mass production of bread started . they say being a professional baker started then .
yeah , that ' s true ! around the time of being a baker started roman baker ##s started putting honey and oil in bread creating past ##ries and i ' m thankful they did ha ##ha
our blood is red . i am a doctor so i see a lot of red . did you that iron gives the red color to our blood ?
color red was very important in history . only nobility had a red clothes and dresses .
well in the renaissance red was the most popular color . one of the first pigment made by men was red , from och ##re
well i did ' t know that , thank for sharing . red is also color of a grand canyon
they are actually filter feeder ##s , so they feed on zoo ##pl ##an ##kt ##on .
i ' m not sure if they are at risk , but they are definitely protected by the convention of migratory species of wild animals .
man ##ta ray ' s get ##ation period lasts for over a year , so it takes quite a long time . they also give birth to live pup ##s .
hmm ##m , i ' m not sure if it has any specific meaning , but " man ##ta " is a genus .
there are various traditions in costume and performance for clown ##s . i guess you ' re talking about the stephen king movie , it ?
well , yeah there actually were a bunch of clown sighting ##s in 2016 , but i think it was just people messing around .
well just think that they try to entertain large audiences , and not try to kill people in most cases .
well , yeah that ' s true . most circus clown ##s become famous and have their own acts . i don ' t think they are mean .
yeah i have heard some may be sold in a flat bone - shape as well
i read in a magazine that ##some manufacturers claim the dry and hard bis ##cuit texture helps clean the dog ' s teeth
have you ever heard of " dog ' s bread " ? it is made out of bran .
no i have not seen that . but it is mentioned as early as 1623 in a play by lo ##pe de vega
it ' s fatigue that is not due to st ##ren ##uous ex ##ert ##ion and rest doesn ' t really provide much relief . it ' s not due to a previous medical condition , so its cause remains somewhat of a mystery .
no , unfortunately not . there is no cure and no medications or procedures to treat cf ##s have been approved in the us .
i think it ' s pretty uncommon , but miserable for those who suffer from it . fortunately tentative evidence supports the use of a new medication , ri ##nta ##to ##lim ##od . but not enough evidence for fda approval . maybe one day !
well , as you may have imagined , he was the superhero who kind of started it all . his success in the years since he was created in 1933 , he helped usher in the classic superhero arch ##ety ##pe and set its prima ##cy within the american comic book . he ' s an icon for a reason .
right you are ! technically born in ka ##l - el , planet k ##ry ##pton , and then sent to earth as an infant . this was due to his father , jo ##r - el , sending him there before the planet ' s destruction . from there , he was raised on a farm in kansas ! raised as clark kent , with a strong moral com ##pas .
i think you may know more about superman than you think ! it was an older farm couple , right . and they raised him , and through his childhood he kind of dropped hints of his powers here and there , through different abilities , and then when he turned into an adult he fully grew into his superhero identity and started using his powers to save mankind .
right . well , if you want to search him later on , he goes by many names . big blue boy scout , man of steel , man of tomorrow . . . last son of k ##ry ##pton . . the list goes on .
i have tried some low car ##b diet ##s that restrict car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##te consumption
yes , the atkins diet is classified as a low car ##b diet , developed by robert atkins
it has , but then i wind up eating excessive food intake and lack of physical activity and i end up back where i was
cookies and cakes . the heat gradually transfers from the surface to the center in regular oven ##s to get that baked taste .
it has a fa ##mi ##lia ##l past where women and some men make things in baker ##ies and rest ##aru ##ants for local consumption
i think it later became industrial ##ized and machines and baking was done in large factories later .
i had thai cuisine with extra chili ##s on my chicken it was so delicious .
its light dishes that have strong flavors and have a spicy edge to them .
its more on the vegetarian side but does have meat . many ingredients have medicinal benefit as well as good flavor and smells .
yes ! he was adopted by a couple from kansas . they raised him as clark kent .
the movie was released in 1978 and it was directed by richard don ##ner .
it was released in 1980 .
superman was created by a writer named jerry siegel and an artist named joe shu ##ster . they were high school students .
i like to strengthen muscles and my cardiovascular system .
i like to play rugby in the community amateur sports club in my area .
no not really . it ' s pretty safe .
it is a common stereo ##type and i play as a defender .
yes regional street food like ta ##cos .
in north america , tor ##till ##as are made from ground corn .
that ' s right ! domestic ##ated by people of south mexico ten thousand years ago .
yes the aztec ##s , where people of central mexico .
yes . there are a large number of variants of traditional dishes too . like las ##ag ##na , for example .
i ' ve never had las ##ag ##na with shrimp . sounds good though . but , italian cuisine has developed through the centuries .
yes . there are 2 types of pasta as well . dried and fresh . i definitely prefer fresh .
i ' ve actually made my own once . it ' s easy . it ' s just se ##mo ##lina or flour and water .
nice , a lot of professionals , exhibit ##ors , and pre - registered guests , you can get lucky and see someone famous too !
yes it is pretty expensive , and its a four - day event ( thursday – sunday ) held during the summer , so staying there also makes it more expensive
yes san diego zoo is awesome it houses over 3 , 700 animals , its huge !
i like that it isn ##t common and its my birthday day of the month , its a cool number .
besides the number 17 ? i like 8 too .
i like the nu ##me ##br 8 since it can be any number if adjusted on a cal ##cula ##tor
the base number on a cal ##cula ##tor is 8 as in if you take 2 lines out of the block 8 it makes 2 or 5
i love water skiing also , but it has been a long time since i have ski ##ed . there are dozens of sports that include water .
that is such a fun game . water skiing has over 900 competitions every year and 11 million skier ##s .
yes , it requires a lot of upper body strength and balance . you must have strong muscles also .
yes , they are responsible for proper movements and not injuring their organs , such as the heart .
it ' s one of the most established , famous and recognized comedy clubs in the us . lots of laughs there
some of the greatest . my favorite was patrice o ' neal ( rip ) , but others i ' ve seen were larry david , greg gi ##ral ##do , dave at ##tell and rich vo ##s
i ' m not totally sure about that , but there was a show on a & e network called " caroline ' s comedy hour " and it was good . it won cable ##ace award for best stand - up comedy series . you should check that out since you like stand - up
it is a prime number so it cannot be formed by multi ##ply ##ing two smaller natural numbers
right ! there are an infinite number of prime numbers .
according to eu ##cl ##id , there are infinitely many prime numbers !
that ' s true , and philosophers and mathematicians treat infinity differently .
i love the beatles ! rock and roll did not acquire its name until 1954 .
interesting . music in the 2000s saw the creation or emergence of a few styles , such as indie - related genres such as em ##o , alternative r & b , and a multitude of new electronic sub ##gen ##res , most notably dub ##ste ##p .
i agree ! the convergence of different styles was one of the more defining features of the 2000s , as seen with the creation and commercial success of the british grim ##e genre and trap music and chill ##wave in the united states .
it ' s a great service . it was launched in public beta on september 25 , 2007 , in january 2008 it became the first music store to sell music without digital rights management ( dr ##m ) from the four major music labels .
it was on a vacation in hawaii at the garden eel cove
the are really cool . they have large mouths , horn fins and triangle shaped pe ##ctor ##al fins
not really . they spend most of their time feeding on plank ##ton
no but i love going there . there is so much to explore , because they have hundreds of islands spread over
there are over 310 di ##ffe ##ern ##t types of pasta known by over 1300 names , so its hard to know what was the first served
ca ##vate ##lli is known by 28 different names in italy
they are small shells that look like miniature hot dog bun ##s
it takes a lot child care is the action or skill of looking after children by a day - care center , nan ##nies and others
yes , it covers a wide spectrum of professionals , institutions , contexts
i agree , early child care is an equally important and often overlooked component of child development
i totally agree with you . the child ' s behavior , and is often as simple as " keeping an eye out " for younger siblings .
i have never seen a red panda although i understand it has reddish - brown fur and a long shaggy tail .
i understand that panda diplomacy is how china diplomatic ##ally gifts panda ##s to other countries .
why are red panda ##s better considering this reason ?
i see that red panda ##s are considered endangered because it is estimated that there are less than 10 , 000 mature individuals and the numbers continue to decline .
i do also , the practice of wine ta ##sti ##n is as ancient as its production .
i wish i was a professional wine taste ##r known as a somme ##lier .
i am a recreational ta ##stor . i do not use an analytical process .
but it is ve ##r strange , only occurs naturally in 1 - 2 % of the human population so it is very strange to find it !
yes it is so difficult to find red hair , that is probably why so many people like it !
yes i think so too , if y ##pu want to fin red hair people you must go to europe ! 2 - 6 % of the red hair people are northern or western european ancestry !
red is a cool favorite color to have , considering its history . ancient egyptians and maya ##ns would use red to color their faces during important ceremonies .
red is considered to be a more romantic or aggressive color psychological ##ly , which is why some heterosexual men think that red outfits enhance female attractive ##ness . it ' s so cool to think that color can make all the difference .
yeah , it is ! next to green and blue . it ' s also a primary color in the cm ##yk color model , which is lesser known .
red has dominant wavelength of apr ##ox 625 - 740 nano ##met ##res
red also a primary color in the r ##gb color model
the reason i personally don ' t like the color red is bea ##cus ##e i have blood ph ##ob ##ia
but personally i think you going for red hair is awesome
what is scary is they do not know the exact cause , its not even genetic or biological .
is mainly based off a persons symptoms , so age does not appear to matter .
it seems like it just depends on the person
unfortunately , there is no cure , with treatment
i agree ! some of the new type of music nowadays i just don ' t understand . i miss just the classic saxophone or piano in some of the current music .
i have been introducing my teenagers to some of the old classic rock and i have actually caught them listening to it without me . definitely the kind of music we need to keep alive !
i agree ! i miss the days of mtv and all of the great music videos
even vh1 was awesome . i believe they were launched in the mid 80 ' s
they have a pretty rich history . these comic performers often use slap ##stick methods for laughs
that ' s an interesting ti ##db ##it . the modern clown is closely tied with the circus clown , which grew out of earlier theatrical performances
that ' s very fair . they can be weird . the first mainstream clown was portrayed by joseph grim ##aldi .
do you dye your hair independently or get it done prof ##es ##ii ##onal ##ly ?
hair coloring is very popular , 75 % of women and 18 % of men do it !
there is no specific color but almost everyone does it to cover gray or white hair for the most part
a greek historian detailed dying hair , celtic people dyed it blonde , and it was seen as terrifying
i love any exercise really . anything that helps me enhance or maintain fitness and overall health and wellness . do you like to exercise ?
oh , well it ' s very important . i ' m sure you know that it boost ##s the immune systems and helps prevent diseases like heart disease , diabetes , and obesity !
it does but please make time for it ! it can prevent cardiovascular disease like ang ##ina and my ##oca ##rdial in ##far ##ction !
okay , good . it is also a measure of how well a human and cope or adapt with various situations . you know life can be unpredictable !
if i recall first reference dating to 115 ##4 in sicily
commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta dishes , pasta is typically a no ##odle made from an un ##lea ##ven ##ed dough . you can make a lot of differ ##net pasta
i think it is spa ##get ##tie and some pasta ##s can be made using rice flour in place of wheat .
changes to diet and exercising are the best treatments .
ke ##to ##genic diet could be a good plan to help reduce fat . it ' s a high - fat , adequate - protein , and low - car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##te diet .
any kind of physical activity can help . walking and swimming are good types of exercises for obe ##se people
that would definitely help your cousin decrease his likelihood of various diseases and conditions .
ye ##a target corporation does very well for them se ##lves as a store and retailer
target corporation was founded by george dayton in minnesota
yep outside of target corporation head ##qua ##ters being there minnesota is useless
i know that you can do it at home independently . have you tried that before ?
that makes sense . did you have a specific reason for dye ##ing your hair ? i know people do it to cover gray or white hair . or to just make their hair more fashionable .
ha ##ha sounds like you needed a change ! hair coloring is very popular in copenhagen . 75 percent of female and 18 percent of men have dyed their hair before .
ye ##a it is huge here . the hair coloring industry reached around 2 . 2 billion dollars back in 2016 .
well since most hair coloring is done by a professional hair ##dre ##sser id go with that but you can always do it at home .
hair coloring is super popular , i know that over 75 % of women and 18 % of men dye their hair according to a study by the university of copenhagen .
i know right , hair coloring in the us has reached $ 1 . 9 billion dollars in 2011 and is actually expected to raise to $ 2 . 2 billion by 2020 . .
i don ' t have anyone specific . but i enjoy the classic sound from the 1920s jazz age . it was one of the genres most prominent times .
he ' s a pretty awesome trumpeter and composer . you like his music ?
well they said he developed an instrumental style known as " cool jazz " . it did sound pretty cool !
i actually haven ' t heard a lot of gospel singers . what is yours ? gospel music goes wa ##aa ##y back to the 17th century .
i just don ' t know specific artists . i do love southern gospel the most , which is a type of christian music .
i know a few : south gospel , alternative , contemporary , and traditional , but i ' m sure there ' s many more .
oh that ' s so cool ! were you fishing in tropical waters ? i wouldn ' t even know where to go to fish for them .
i can see that , yeah , they ' re huge . aren ' t they a protected species though ? at least in international waters ?
well they definitely are a problem , rip steve . luckily with a slow reproductive rate they might soon be gone for good .
it is a four - day event ( thursday – sunday ) held during the summer , so it can be a pretty interesting summer vacation for your family : d
yes there are a lot of professionals , exhibit ##ors , and pre - registered guests every year , so famous people are really common
yes i think next time black panther characters will be there , is a 2018 american superhero film based on the marvel comics character of the same name
i didn ##t know that , interesting fact is that its distributed by walt disney studios motion pictures , rather than marvel : d
well , the western g ##hu ##bar arabs ' main contribution was to make the longer line diagonal rather than straight , though they showed some tendencies to making the character more rec ##ti ##line ##ar .
well this is analogous to the horizontal stroke through the middle that is sometimes used in handwriting in the western world but which is almost never used in computer font ##s .
another cool point , both modern arab forms influenced the european form , a two - stroke character consisting of a horizontal upper line joined at its right to a line going down to the bottom left corner , a line that is slightly curved in some font variants .
well you should now find out about the preceding number : 8 !
not really , but i am usually a person in a state considered sober . i feel like drugs just do more harm than anything .
do you know about emi ##nem and his sixth studio album re ##la ##pse ? he struggles with sob ##riety .
yeah that ' s true . he also has the recovery studio album . there is a large problem where i live in the united states .
yeah that made me think back to this one time when my drunk roommate was reading about the spanish empire ' s main source of wealth was gold and silver from me ##xi ##ci . crazy times .
apparently levels of mel ##ani ##n can cause hair color to change . hopefully you will get some " un ##pi ##gm ##ented hair " in your beard !
yes my son is fair complexion ##ed as well , and has light skin . he either burns or stays casper .
brown hair most common in europe and the us , so maybe that ' s a possibility .
absolutely nothing , sob ##riety is considered to be the natural state of a human being given at birth . do you drink often ?
just make sure to keep your alcohol intake in check , in some cases , sob ##riety means having a " life balance " !
sadly , no , sustained abs ##tine ##nce is a pre ##re ##quisite for sob ##riety . i wish though , ha ##ha !
well there are drug rehabilitation centers , which help people process their dependency for substances , but other than that there ' s no magic drug to make you sober .
sure ! red is the color at the end of the visible light spectrum
i do sometimes . depends on my mood i suppose . cool little ti ##db ##it , iron oxide gives mars its blood red color
indeed ! for example , historical ##l , ancient egyptians and maya ##ns colored their faces red in ceremonies while roman generals had red colored bodies to celebrate victories
yep , it ' s a musical based in the 60 ' s .
i have only one time . i really like the different hairs ##tyle ##s people have .
i hear the cr ##azi ##es hairs ##tyle ##s are in thailand .
they are crazy because in thailand they believe hairs ##tyle ##s offer protection .
yes it ' s been a great motivation for me , it made me want to exercise but i am too lazy .
yes me too . not to go to the beach , but simply because warm weather is hard on my body .
i enjoy getting some sun on cooler days , but i mostly tan at home since i am too ashamed to go shirt ##less in public .
nah i usually eat junk from mcdonald ##s and local pizza places . you ?
yes . . i like blue too . it is pretty attractive as it is at the dominant wave length
it is too technical i guess . . . lets leave it
i am afraid i don ##t know exactly . . but could guess . . may be green and brown
other than usual in ##firm ##ations i remember mars when i th ##unk red . . do you have any other facts
you can also barbecue in the oven .
yes as long as its done slowly over low indirect heat .
yes , oven have been around since 29 , 000 bc .
same here , red has a dominant wavelength of about 625 to 740 nano ##met ##res .
it is also a compliment ##ary color to cy ##an which is surprising to me .
they really are . it ' s a primary color too , in the r ##gb model .
same but both are great italian sports cars
yep one day i hope to own a ferrari sports car
it was founded by enzo ferrari in 1938
i heard the gu ##lly in south australian is a great location so maybe there .
no not in person i have not but i ' m sure it looks beautiful from how the ice crystals form .
how was it staying by the lake michigan that is one of the greatest lakes in the united states ?
it does , but it ' s not well documented . the earliest use of the term " gospel song " was first published in 1874 .
well actually , before it was known as gospel music , that typical style of music can be traced back to the early 17th century .
not really , it was known for it ' s hand clapping , foot st ##omp ##ing and a cappella singing though !
interesting ##ly enough , after world war ii gospel music really took off ! it moved into major auditorium ##s and the concerts became quite elaborate ! i ' ll bet that was something to see !
well , one of the obvious ones is using an oven but you can also ba ##ke on hot ashes / stones .
me too . honestly , the closest i will get to baking anything is in the easy - ba ##ke oven which is a working toy oven introduced in 1963 by has ##bro . yes i know , my baking levels are that of a child .
well , by 1997 , more than 16 million were sold so i don ' t think they could be too hard to come by .
no one can dance these days like they used to in 80 ' s music lo ##l . madonna , prince and journey are awesome

well my hair is brown now , or brunette as a lot of people call it .
i know , this pigment ##ation is what determines darker or paler hair colors .
that ' s oddly similar to iron rust . speaking of this , hair color can often determine hair thickness , like red hair being the thin ##nes ##t .
i wonder if this associates with the fact that darker hair is more common among the western world .

there is more hair one the head of people of darker hair color .
indeed , and the color blond is due to the low level of eu ##mel ##ami ##n

if you ' ve never heard of the yo ##ru ##ba people , you should have ! they have 45 - 50 twin sets per 1000 live births and they believe this is all due to the consumption of a certain ya ##m that contains est ##rogen .

pasta comes in 2 forms usually . dried and fresh . always go with fresh if you can .
it ' s just so strong , its so imp ##ulsive ! it ' s all , " hey ! i ' m red , you see this ? "
it ' s probably because blood is red , so when people see it , they ' re like " stuff ##s going down " and just the color in general .
i never even thought of that , very true . it ' s also the most dominant wavelength .
what do you know about the color yellow ?
he did the twelve step program through alcoholic anonymous . we ' re very proud of him .
not particularly , but he does help other alcoholic ##s make it through the program .
aa takes their theory from the big book which also helps other addiction ##s such as heroin addiction , marijuana addiction , and gambling addiction .

yes brown hair has thicker strands than blond hair but thinner than red hair
blond hair has a very low level of the pigment eu ##mal ##ani ##n
yes . the levels of pigment can change over time which is one reason young children often have their hair color change
the white wines have a long history , too . the white wines have been around for nearly 2 , 500 years , and they are produced through the fe ##rm ##entation of non - colored pulp ##s of grapes . do you ever use wine in your cooking ?
yes ; i actually replace the wine with white grape juice in my cooking . sparkling wine is another style of wine that is used basically with carbon dioxide . it makes it all fi ##zzy and fun !

it ' s called color psychology .

you should definitely learn ! it ' s one of the basics and helps with color mixing and combination .
it can be played in guitar , and drums . it ' s characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals . its very fun .

the company that owns it was originally named good ##fell ##ow dry goods and opened in 1902
yeah . the company eventually became hudson company in 1969 and held ownership of several department store chains .

i ' m not 100 % on that , but i do know that all cars have to conform to the " formulas " set of rules .
they are rated as the world ' s most powerful brand by brand finance in 2014 , so even the newer ones must pack a punch !

i love blue ray wine , the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production
yes it is , modern , professional wine taste ##rs ( such as somme ##lier ##s or buyers for retailers ) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors ,
i also love pink - which is actually a very light shade of red . it ' s a mixture of white and red . men used to sometimes wear pink suits because , as a watered down shade of red , i sign ##ified passion or anger tempered by self - control
what shade of yellow do you prefer ? i like pale paste ##l yellow , because it reminds me of spring time !
speaking of the colors of the rainbow , i used to watch the animated show , rainbow brit ##e . i don ' t know if you ' ve heard of it but it was about a magical girl that had to stop the gloom ##ies from stealing the colors of the rainbow . the show had an amazing range of colors .
chemicals on hair are never good , i agree . apparently people in the us don ' t care , spending almost 1 . 9 billion on hair color .
well , since red hair only occurs naturally in 1 - 2 % of the population , many dye their hair a shade of red .
hair coloring popular with 75 % of women . i teach and many students , male and female , color their hair various shades of blue and green .
since co ##sm ##eto ##logists cut and color hair , i ' m thinking that might be a good career to get into !
yeah , and its a major form of musical expression
it ' s been around since the 19th century , getting it ' s roots from blues and rag ##time .
jazz involves more improvisation and has a more upbeat swing .

anytime . one alien based movie i did not like was cowboys and aliens . i was surprised as i am a harrison ford fan
good question , its actually most common in the western world , especially with europe , usa and even some populations in the middle east
i guess that ' s just personal preference but i know the strands are thicker than fair hair but as much as red hair !
i ' m not sure but if i had to take a guess i would say that in europe , most definitely but in the middle east , i would doubt it very much . the cool thing about brown hair is it varies from l ##ght brown to almost black hair ( mine is almost black that you kinda can ##t tell if its black or not )
funny enough , people with brown hair are often referred to as brunette , in french that ' s the feminine form or " br ##une ##t "
there are 310 specific forms though ! that ' s almost one for every day of the year ! ha ##ha !
oh yeah ! there ' s a ton of varieties ! and if you get tired of the typical flour pasta , you can try pasta made from rice flour !
i ' ve had rice noodles in chinese food and they were really good ! very light and g ##lu ##ten free !
you should ! i ' m just glad that pasta is commercially produced and is widely available in supermarkets . i ' d hate to go back to the days where they had to make their own pasta . that would be hard !
yes , me either . i think they are so expensive because in 2014 , they were rated the world ' s most powerful brand
not sure about fastest as it varies with each car but in 2012 , the 1962 gt ##o became the most expensive car in history .
yes . it was a private transaction too . no crazy salesman ha ##ha
that probably contributes to why its the largest us port and metro ##pol ##itia ##n area in louisiana
actually baton rouge might be as it is the parish on the mississippi river
it is the parish seat of east baton rouge so maybe a part of it connects to water maybe ?
that sounds great ! i really like spaghetti and las ##ag ##na . but recently i started using a g ##lu ##ten free rice pasta .
i have been diet ##ing so i had to cut back . but the store has a lot of variety when it comes to fresh and dried pasta
no i will check it out , for me their is just to many options since their are 310 forms known of pasta .
they have triangular pe ##ctor ##al fins . scary
they eat a large amount of zoo ##pl ##an ##kt ##on as they swim
i do not know that . marine life produces oxygen for us
yes , it is . fresh pasta was traditionally made by hand , but now fresh pasta is commercially produced , thank goodness . i ' d rather buy it in a supermarket than make it by hand !
very true ! sometimes i eat pasta made with rice flour . it ' s not bad and it helps my g ##lu ##ten into ##ler ##ance . have you tried rice pasta ?
yeah , it ' s not the same . it ' s hard to believe that there are 310 specific forms of pasta . there ' s truly something for everyone !
they certainly have ! have you ever heard of " ca ##vate ##lli " pasta ? there are 28 different names for that specific pasta depending on what region or town you ' re in . isn ' t that crazy ?
where were you in the water when you encountered the ray ? i know they are found in temperate , subtropical and tropical waters .
i find it kind of cool that they are filter feeder ##s which means they eat zoo ##pl ##an ##kt ##on which they swallow as they swim with their mouths open ! lo ##l
i ' m not sure about whales . i also found it fascinating that man ##ta rays ge ##station period last over a year !
i hope not too many since obesity is linked to diabetes and sleep ap ##nea and more .
eating less would definitely help , since obesity can cause even cancer .
i ' m not sure , but obesity can even cause os ##te ##oa ##rth ##rit ##is and depression .
ferrari built their first car in 1940 - so they ' ve been on the market quite a while - what kind of cars do you see in your town ?
although the ferrari 1962 250 gt ##o is the most expensive car in history , my choice is probably a jeep wr ##ang ##ler .
my dad has two - but i like the basic wr ##ang ##ler sport utility - top down and sun shining ! !
yes , that can be true . some peoples metabolism ##s are different depending on how much energy they are using .
a healthy b ##mi is always in accordance to dividing persons weight by their height , if its over the range , they are over ##weight .
some eastern asian countries use lower values , i guess their people are off that scale because they are smaller in stature and weight
mainly chat about the bikes , like the shovel ##head engine because it looked like coal be shovel ##ed into the engine when turned upside down lo ##l
i believe you ' re right , there ##s an entire section in the harley davidson museum which goes over those rules . ha ##ha . i try to get out as often as i can , work tends to sc ##uppe ##r that though
i ' ll try to get over to america to celebrate the the founding in 1903 , milwaukee wisconsin here i come : - )

ha ##ha are you into a lot of fantasy books then ? sounds that way .
yes i do love harry potter but i ' m more into game of throne ##s and medieval fantasy .
my favorite house in hog ##wart ##s is griffin ##dor yourself ?
it just depends on the area and genetics . twins are either identical or fra ##tern ##al .
fra ##tern ##al twins are two eggs fe ##rti ##lized by sperm , where identical is only one z ##y ##go ##te that splits .
the twin birth rate in the us has risen 76 % from 1980 through 2009 .
not sure . perhaps fertility drugs . the yo ##ru ##ba people have the highest rate of twin ##ning , at 45 - 50 per 1 , 000 live births .
his real name is calvin cord ##oza ##r broad ##us , jr . ( born october 20 , 1971
lo ##l , his music career began in 1992 when he was discovered by dr . dr ##e , and as a result he was featured on dr ##e ' s solo debut , " deep cover
don ' t really know , but i know that in 1994 snoop released a soundtrack on death row records for the short film " murder was the case "
boy grains have been around as a staple food for mill ##enia . baking those grains is really rather old .
well we know that there were enclosed oven ##s used by the greeks in the fifth and sixth century bc .
baker ##s will make bread using an oven , or any heat source to ba ##ke bread .
you don ' t need much in order to ba ##ke bread . all you need is dough of flour and water , plus a heat source of course .
that ' s very true . and it ' s an interesting bit of color psychology that police officers will more likely pull over red cars than other cars .
or desire , as it happens . research suggests het ##ero men believe that women who wear red are much more attractive than otherwise .
whether positive or negative , its usage goes pretty far back in history . victorious roman generals had their entire bodies painted red to celebrate .
i feel it ' s name is what makes it popular the most . brands are used in marketing and advertising to make people want to buy them .
i ' d rather have a new ford mustang myself .
i ' ve wanted one since they were introduced back in early 1964 .
yep , way better than a chrysler or fiat
me too ! i always made such a mess ! interesting ##ly , there were $ 1 . 9 billion in sales of at home coloring in the u . s . 2011 !
it sure is ! i ' d rather get it done at the hair dresser whenever i want to change to a color regarded as more fashionable
just be careful , if you spill it , it makes a big mess ! and i never realized until recently that 75 % of women in copenhagen have used hair dye !
yep ! i guess it ' s the price we pay for changing the hair color !
black is the most common hair color and i am not sure about the third , probably blonde .
higher levels of the dark pigment eu ##mel ##ani ##n and lower levels of the pale pigment ph ##eo ##mel ##ani ##n result in darker hair .
mel ##ani ##n is a group of natural pigment ##s found in most organisms . how much a person has is hereditary .
no it is not from environment . it is from genetics .
it originated in the african - am ##er ##cian communities of new orleans during the late 19th and early 20th centuries
i believe so , since the 1920 it has been as a major form of musical expression .
it is characterized by call and response vocals , swing and blue notes , and the poly ##rh ##yt ##hm ##s and improvisation
adelaide hall was a great one she was jazz singer and entertainer .
yes definitely ! there are reds and whites . my favorite is white wine . it can range in color from straw - yellow to yellow - gold
yes , the reds are more sweet and the whites a little " sharpe ##r " . wine is made starting with fruit that is then fe ##rm ##ented into alcohol . most people use grapes but it can be made with berries too .
yes they do ! it ' s called wine pairing . i have a friend who does it . there is also the ritual consumption of wine by the jewish since biblical times . like the last supper with jesus for example .
interesting ! i had no idea . i know that christians have different views on alcohol . not everyone feels the same about it .
early in time , the number 7 was written more in one stroke as a curve .
i ' m not very sure about that . however the number was developed from a 6 look ##ali ##ke by eastern arabs .
modern arabs influenced the european form of the number turning it into a two stroke character .
oh , maybe one ##c you know the history you might give it a try . jazz has been recognized as a major form of musical expression since the 20 ' s .
lo ##l , that make s total sense . i do love the poly ##rh ##yt ##hm ##s and improvisation of jazz though . i could see using some of that with my vocals .
i guess that ##s why in ##elle ##cta ##uls hail jazz as " one of america ' s original art forms " .
now that i think more , they do make street bikes , but like smaller versions of harley davidson ##s
i have always wanted to try a snow ##mobile , snow recreation in general is a favorite of mine , and quick travel in a big blizzard would be cool
speaking of blizzard , have you ever played star ##craft 1 or 2 ? 2 is my favorite , blizzard did a fantastic job making that game
it is not the biggest game , but it is cool to watch . it is a real time strategy science fiction game but the original , which came out in 1998 , is still played compete ##tively
i ' m not sure . i was hoping you knew . in victorian times the maids were expected to remain unmarried .
because they needed to devote all their time to the household . even the highest - ranking workers , like butler ##s , could be dismissed if they married .
it sure is . they used to suffer from bu ##rs ##itis because of all the time spent on their knees scrub ##bing and lighting the fires .
i ' m not sure . could you imagine someone trying to get away with that now ? they used to call bu ##rs ##itis house ##maid ' s knee .
i ' m 47 , so with age comes increasing gray , i know . however , i am very young at heart .
i ' m just going to say it ; i like you . you seem very wise and practical .
age has little to do with wisdom . thor ##eau discussed the error of respecting the aged , just because they were older . wisdom can manifest itself in anyone .
i ' d say you did . have you ever read walden ? it ' s message of self - reliance and personal independence might res ##onate with a thoughtful mind like yours .
i have heard people are generally considered obe ##se when their body mass index ( b ##mi ) , a measurement obtained by dividing a person ' s weight by the square of the person ' s height ,
you should know obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases and conditions ,
yeah and on average , obe ##se people have a greater energy expenditure than a healthy person
it will change your life . any company that can make it through periods of poor economic health and product quality , as well as intense global competition know how to make a product that will rock your socks off .

i understand she was a genius at incorporating so many musical styles , like classical , jazz , blue , folk , gospel , and more .
the queen of jazz ! i know ella fitzgerald . lady ella , they called her !
i was blessed with very think hair . is your hair thick ?
brown hair is a very common hair color . is your hair long ?
that is a shame . long hair is very attractive .
even more odd is the granny hair trend where young women are coloring their hair different shades of gray .
yes . they say the trend is attributed to fa ##sion designer jean - paul gaul ##tier ' s 2011 fashion show
i love " cool hand luke " where they refer to defeated vi ##lli ##ans as mu ##llet heads .
i don ' t have a strict one either but i try to eat the right foods and exercise some .
it sure is . so i take it you don ' t shop at places like whole foods ?

do you have any wal - mart stores where you can buy nutritional stuff ?
there * oh , wow ! i haven ' t been scuba diving . do you wear a dry suit that normally protects the body ?
interesting ! so the difference between dry suits and wet ##suit ##s is that dry suits prevent water from entering ?
i see ! and the bubbles give the wet suit low density , so it helps provide bu ##oya ##ncy in the water .
it was great , i was what you would call an infantry ##man in the ranks .
i used to engage in military combat on foot .
yes , as an infantry ##man we bear the largest br ##unt and deployment is inevitable for us .
horrible , it caused me a lot of physical and psychological stress because we lost a lot of casualties .

the country singer from australia stan cost ##er never sang about roller coaster ##s . i do not enjoy them , but surely they are nt faster than cars ?
disney world opened in the 1970 ' s . i never went there . it seems like they ' d have a lot of lines and it ' d bee too hot . how much do hot dogs os ##t there ?
they ' re highly influential especially because of their vocal harmonies and surf songs
that ' s amazing , i can ' t believe that ' s their 11th studio album !
no not really but i ' m a big fan of their smile album
ok , well . . hair coloring can be done professionally by a hair ##dre ##sser or independently at home ; most of the time it ' s done at home to save money
i ' m unsure of the history but i think it dates back to an ##ice ##nt roman / greece
yes i have a few times . . . hair coloring is very popular , with 75 % of women and 18 % of men living in copenhagen having reported using hair dye according to a study by the university of copenhagen .
not that i know of
i ' ll bet ! dogs seem to like dog biscuits like humans love snack food ! i know i ' d be happy if someone handed me snack food a few times a day ! ha !
i think they ' re made mostly from bran . way back in roman times , dog treats were mentioned to be " dog ' s bread . " it ' s hard to believe dog treats have been around for so long , isn ' t it ?
spain jumped into the dog treat trend back in 1623 . they called treats , pan de per ##ro , which translates also to dog ' s bread . people have been pam ##per ##ing their pets for ages !
it ' s pretty crazy that dog baker ##ies actually exist . they even make treats for dogs with all ##er ##gies , dietary needs or bad breath ! i think they definitely eat better than me !
not sure ! but i know of a char ##cter named lucky on the show general hospital . the characters name is lucky spencer . cool name , huh ?
i don ##t see anything about his favorite number , but i know he wa born in 1985 . nothing to do with the number 7 though : / he was cast in 93 for the show .
no , i don ##t know of any shows , but i think there ##s a movie called se ##7 ##en . it has jj ##im carey in it if im not mistaken . i really like medicine shows though . they ##re touring acts that help heal people between different kinds of entertainment . its actually real ##l cool
not that i know of . it ##w as ##nt that good of a movie ; usually shows like i like have their own patent medicine .
i learned that they were a racing team before they produced sports cars . i thought it was the other way around .
i am surprised to hear that . the fact that he was a racing driver would make me believe he wanted sports cars .
that is very impressive . i guess it ' s why great racers such as schumacher wanted to join the team .
eu ##mel ##ain is what causes dark hair - the more of it there is the darker the hair
hair coloring is very popular now . 75 % of women in copenhagen have used hair dye
even 18 % of men have colored their hair !
yes gray hair is associated with age and many people don ##t want to be thought of as old
that ' s . . . true . don ' t think they had many laser pointer ##s back then though . i ' m excited that we may be going to mars , the red planet , soon !
maybe the mars exploration rovers would have had more success if they were driven by ancient egyptians and maya ##ns .
cool . i feel like i could smash some stone ##ware pottery right now out of frustration , to be honest .
brown hair is the second most common behind black hair .
it has higher levels of dark pigment .
brown hair strands are thicker than fair hair .
well first its very important to know that pasta ##s are divided into two groups , dried ( " pasta sec ##ca " ) and fresh ( " pasta fr ##es ##ca " ) . and both have a entire different taste .
well pasta originated as an italian cuisine food from italy , so if you want the best pasta you have to visit italy .
well not really but pasta is a staple food of tal ##ian cuisine , it dates back to 115 ##4 in sicily . most italian pasta is as good though .
well spaghetti is just a long , thin , solid type of pasta . so its just the same thing but thinner that other pasta ##s .
yep pasta ia a great italian food , i love all pasta
pasta is so old , the first reference dating to 115 ##4 in sicily .
ye ##a pasta is an italian staple be ##cas ##ue its been around so long so it makes sense
same i didn ##t either
hem ##ati ##te is iron oxide and is widespread in rock and soil .
it actually can be many other colors , like black , but the version at the grand canyon is more red .
i would love to one day , just the known history goes back almost 11 , 000 years !
i think many can walk down and then you use a donkey to get back up .
me too , i just act on a w ##him when stressed sometimes . however even though stress can be horrible , sometimes it may be beneficial too , for example in compete ##tive situations .
it does play a role in motivation , as well as adaptation to the environment . i myself started thinking of stress as a more positive thing , in the past i used to only focus on the discomfort .
lately my wife and i have been apart for work related reasons , i decided to take on eu ##dai ##mon ##ic perspective , in psychology it ' s the concept of a " good life " , living according to greatest values in life , and thought to myself the stress motivation can help me finish up working faster and come back to my wife while app ##re ##cia ##ting i have a job .
yeah that ' s hard . but it ' s important to still focus on your well - being , happiness and content ##ment and making most of this experience in such a situation . besides , it makes the relationship stronger .
i have never ridden . i ' m too scared . under the harley - davidson brand , among them apparel , home decor and ornaments , accessories , toys , and scale figures of its motorcycles , and video games based on its motorcycle line and the community .
in 2014 , the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were honda , yamaha ( both from japan ) , and hero mo ##to ##corp ( india ) ! !
yes . i am brand loyal as well .
yes , sorry i wasn ' t specific . apparently they belong to the genus " man ##ta " .
so man ##ta rays are direct relatives of sting ##ray ##s ( in the same family " my ##lio ##bat ##iform ##es " ) but lack the sting ##er .
from what i know they ' re all rays , but there is a fairly wide variety . apparently there are even freshwater varieties .
especially if you were on a river and not expecting to see a sting ##ray .
it tr ##usly must be . it ' s crazy though that brown hair varies so much . it goes from light to almost black
yes , it ' s great that brown hair is actually more common in the western parts of the world .
i do know it is a bit in scotland because they call it " br ##un "
i wonder where blond hair comes from ? i know its much more rare .
i don ' t know the exact numbers , but the us contains one of the highest percentage of obe ##se people in the entire world . that ' s not a good stat ##istic for us !
absolutely ! obesity is usually prevent ##able in most cases through a combination of personal choices and social changes . we need to eat less and exercise more !
no one is really sure why women have more instances of obesity , but it ' s a huge problem . people who are obe ##se have higher instances of type 2 diabetes , depression , cardiovascular diseases and even cancer !
that ' s very true . obesity not only hurts your health , but your pockets as well ! an average obe ##se american inc ##urs an averages $ 1 , 42 ##9 more in medical bills annually than their average weight counterparts .
yes they are so large too ! and belong to the genus man ##ta .
so they are similar to whales as in they breach , but no one really knows why !
well i knot there ' s a larger species that ' s called m . bi ##ros ##tri ##s width wise .
well with their triangular pe ##ctor ##al fins they can ! so they do not struggle as much . pretty cool right /
some people seem to think it is hard to lose weight but it really isn ' t . people are considered obe ##se when their b ##mi is over a certain limit .
it is pretty accurate a lot of the time but that is true . it is done by dividing a person ' s weight by the square of the person ' s height .
well the idea that obe ##se people can eat little and still gain weight due to metabolism is generally not supported , thankfully .
well i disagree slightly , since metabolism is such a small factor compared to excessive food intake or lack of physical activity .
his powers aren ' t as intimidating as the potential super ##power russia is becoming
china and prc are much more of a worry simply because they have slowly become the leader of the world under everyone ' s ' nose
peoples republic of china . united states - china relations have not been good . you should look into the " pi ##vot to asia " movement in us politics
the foreign relations of the prc have led to great friction ##s between all nations , no one wants to mess with them for fear of economic di ##sta ##bil ##ization
the creation , performance , significance , and even the definition of gospel music varies by location . and it has been around since the 30 ' s
i did a few years back . i played guitar but gospel music usually has dominant vocals
pianos and trump ##het ##s , gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century in the south .
its not for everyone . hymns and sacred songs were often repeated over and over again ,
i only know they are found in the sub ##tro ##pic ##s . i would assume places like australia or wherever they can feed on zoo ##pl ##an ##kt ##on .
i know the oceanic ones are the biggest . don ##t know how big . the larger ones are the bi ##ros ##tri ##s species .
yes . the smaller one is the alfred ##i species . i believe those are the only two .
i have no idea . i always assumed they were all grey like whales . they are almost similar . they too breach for no reasons that are unknown .
yeah they both have triangular pe ##ctor ##al fins !
yeah and they have been placed in the family my ##lio ##bat ##idae !
im not sure but they are filter feeder ##s and eat large quantities of zoo ##pl ##an ##kt ##on
the company was founded by enzo ferrari , you might have heard of it
he founded it in 1939 , but they built their first car in 1940
i don ' t think so , the company was born out of alfa romeo ' s race division
i don ' t think i could pull off that color ( which i love ! ) , but i got tired of people complaining about the grey hairs popping up , so i figured i ' d show them !
see , always thought it was just associated with age , but i ' m in the same boat as you . i got a dash more grey with each kid , and maybe a few pounds heavier as well .
i stopped at two of my own , but when i remarried , my second wife already had a daughter . all girls for me !
when she was younger i did . now it ' s more as a dietary supplement and a snack , like us humans .
i am not sure , but , the biscuits are supposed to help clean the dog ' s teeth , promoting oral health .
no , but just make sure it ' s not dog ' s bread . it ' s a special bread made with ground glass , poison and needles intended to kill dogs .
i don ' t blame you either cake is good .
do you have a favorite type of cake . mine is angel food cake covered in straw ##berries .
mmm ##hm makes me think of german chocolate cake ! i love the coconut pe ##can frost ##ing on top of the cake .
you ever seen the show biggest loser , maybe watching that show would give you motivation . with bob and jillian as your personal trainers .
those are fun colors ! did you have it done professionally or did you dye it at home ?
that makes sense ! home coloring is a huge business ! in 2011 , sales reached $ 1 . 9 billion and they ' re thought to have reached $ 2 . 2 billion in 2016 .
that ' s a good point ! they do always show black or brown ! believe it or not , 75 % of all women claim to have dyed their hair at least once . surely they used some other colors !
for sure ! i think most women continue to color their hair to cover gray or white hair .
me too ! i used to dye my hair . mostly to hide grey ' s , because i wanted to be fashionable .
oh that ' s such a fun color ! i ' ve always wanted to go blue but i ' m not sure i ' m brave enough . some of my favorite artists have blue hair .
i never got into that show or followed the lord family . i think i missed the boat on one life to live .
people really should make better choices with their food . they should also look at their portion sizes
i suppose it could be , but i doubt it . i really believe it ' s about the choices that people make .
i don ' t know , i ' ve never seen an obe ##se family that didn ' t bring their terrible health on themselves .
i suppose with monitored food intake and increased activity . obesity is continuing to grow in the u . s .
but i also think people i identify with batman though , because of his secret id ##enity
he was the billionaire bruce wayne
he also had a side kick named robin
its good that sob ##riety is also considered to be the natural state of a human being given at birth
well everyone needs to have a sustained abs ##tine ##ce or sob ##rite ##y . . which is the fir ##s step
ye ##a it can mess up your liver ! stay away
well im not a stat ##istic ##ian , but people are generally considered obe ##se when their body mass index ( b ##mi ) , a measurement obtained by dividing a person ' s weight by the square of the person ' s height , is over , with the range
obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake , lack of physical activity , and genetic inherited
obesity and walking describes how the loco ##mot ##ion of walking differs between an obe ##se individual and a non - obe ##se individual and a non - obe ##se individual
in the united states has been increasingly cited as a major health issue in recent decades , resulting in diseases such as corona ##ry heart disease that lead to mortality .
the color can be anything from light brown to almost black hair .
brown is brown dude ! the cause is that there are higher levels of the dark pigment eu ##mel ##ani ##n and lower levels of the pale pigment ph ##eo ##mel ##ani ##n .
i am not sure because i have never been out of west virginia and i see very few black people , however , people with brown hair are often referred to as brunette
i did when i was younger . snoop was discovered by dr . dr ##e in 1992 and was featured on dr ##e ' s " deep cover " and " the chronic " albums .
yeah , i do . dr ##e ' s real name is andre young . he was born in 1965 and is a rapper and record producer .
mostly when i was younger but i do still like to listen to emi ##nem , also known as marshall math ##ers , born in 1972 .
agreed . my favorite song of his is " lose yourself " . it really comes from his heart .
that ' s great ! hair coloring actually goes back far in history , a greek historian di ##od ##orus sic ##ulus even mentioned how the celtics dyed their hair blonde .
well i was 22 when i wanted to do it , and then i waited until i was 23 , so not very long .
they were quite supportive actually . i think it ' s become more popular , i heard that 75 % of women in copenhagen have reported using hair dye .
ye ##a they were founded by enzo ferrari in 1939
enzo ferrari founded in out of alfa romeo ##s models
they weren ##t recognized as a auto manufacturer till 1947 tho
wish i had a ferrari sports car .
me too . i love the combination of swing and blues notes , as well as poly ##rh ##yt ##hm ##s which are tough to pull off .
a little bit yes . ever since i started listening to cab call ##owa ##y i have been trying to learn a lot .
i do like the improvisation , i also like that as it spread across the globe a lot of distinctive styles started popping up .
when it comes to pasta and noodles i love fresh angel hair .
ye ##a and you can even make it with rice flour with the rare few who have g ##lu ##ten all ##er ##gies .
oh really , do you prefer dried or fresh pasta ? iv ##e always liked fresh when i can get it .
yep , water flour and eggs are the essential ##s to fresh pasta .
i definitely do , its located in times square in new york city on broadway
well for one its one of the most established , famous , and recognized stand - up comedy clubs in the us
they have head a lot of big names headlining there like louis c . k . , paul reuben ##s , jerry se ##in ##feld , jay len ##o , bill hicks , andrew dice clay , gilbert gottfried , joy be ##har , jon stewart and many more . such an awesome atmosphere .
yes and the negative health effects can include mortality
1 in 4 and the causes are varied from over eating to lack of activity and of course genetics play a part
no cure ##s but treatment includes changes to exercise and diet
obesity is prevent ##able with proper diet and social and personal choices
what do you think about the new york cc ? it ' s not as old as san diego or e ##3 , only first held in 2006 but i think it has potential .
i think you would like comic conventions then , there are usually a wide variety of panels , focusing on super heroes , there is also great co ##sp ##lay .
yes , it is impressive . it has really taken off since the 1990s , the number of people doing it in japan and the western world has risen rapidly .
i don ' t think it ' s ever going to die out . it ' s certainly not a fa ##d .
caring for children ! playing with them and just see them grow
i love kids ! i think early child care is very important
it is hard to find good teachers : ( not everybody has enough patience and love ! and quality care has such a huge impact on the future success of children
it is very expensive unfortunately , that ' s why i had to quit my teaching job when i had my baby . that ' s why usually children are taken care of by parents
i do mainly strength training . it special ##ize in the use of resistance to induce muscular contraction which builds the strength , ana ##ero ##bic endurance , and size of skeletal muscles .
no i focus mainly on weight training which is the most common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles .
of course no . the muscle can be described as a soft tissue found in most animals
it is the 2nd most common hair color !
it is neat , the strands are thicker than strands of lighter hair , but not as thick as red hair strands !
i know right , brown hair is also pretty common in australian ab ##ori ##gin ##es and mel ##ane ##sian
it isn ' t something that can be cured , but chronic fatigue syndrome can be managed .
either use cognitive behavioral therapy , or start exercising more . or both .
nobody knows yet , man . i ' m sorry . some scientists think it ' s biological or genetic , and some think it ' s psychological ##ly based .
a doctor would dia ##gno ##se you based on your symptoms . you said you were tired . what else is wrong ?
people with brown hair are often referred as brunette . that comes from the french term of br ##un , meaning brown .
not that i know of . but another interesting fact about brown hair is that its strand are thicker than those of fair hair , but not as much as red hair .
well , that is sometimes better . i have thick hair and it is more difficult to manage .
thank you . it ' s alcohol . she spent some time in a treatment setting to get started on the path to sob ##riety , but now that she ' s out , she ' s having a tough time .
she isn ' t , but i ' ll definitely pass on the suggestion ! she said the first physical effects of withdrawal were tough , but the second stage , paws , might be worse !
paws stands for post acute withdrawal syndrome . during this stage recovering addict ##s usually experience emotional and psychological symptoms . it ' s due to their brain trying to regain normal function .
thanks for listening ! i think when something takes over your subconscious and tries to get you to fail , abs ##tain ##ing is incredibly difficult ! i ' m hoping this stage passes quickly for her !
can you believe the city near niagara falls was occupied by native americans ?
the only native americans left live on reservations nearby . which there are 250 tribes that live on reservations .
no , they all live on different reservations . some have chosen to not live on reservations at all . of the 500 tribes , only half live on reservations .
i don ' t live on a reservation because i am not a native american and thus i cannot fall under their policy to be encouraged to civil ##ize with them .
richard gordon is an american arranger , composer , songwriter , and classical ##ly trained guitarist who has recorded several contemporary jazz music
since the 1920s jazz age , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression
jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , poly ##rh ##yt ##hm ##s and improvisation
yes , it does seem to be common these days . i homes ##cho ##ol and they even have how to code books for little kids .
yes it is . i prefer to let my kids read things like national geographic kids . i actually like it myself .
i like nat ##ge ##o also , i like it better than the history channel and discovery channel . i also follow them on ins ##tagram .
bon jo ##vi would probably have to be my favorite artist , but i also like listening to older artist like the beatles .
oh that was a great album , it was actually the last time all four of the beatles had a recording session together .
paul mccartney is my favorite , i still listen to his solo stuff from time to time .
they can be used for many different cuisine ##s to add spice ##ness for food dishes .
chili peppers came from mexico .
china happens to be the worlds largest producer of green chili ##es amount ##ing to half the to ##al global amount .
yes there are different types such as the reef mata ray and black man ##ta ray
im not fully sure but i know they can grow to a very large size the oceanic ray is the biggest
in areas such as the oceanic sea of core ##l reef , mainly in warmer climates
well bread is the most common baked item . definitely there are lot of recipes that will talk about it
just give me any staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water and get it baked . i will love it
the only thing that changes when i make bread is sometimes the proportions of types of flour and other ingredients
interesting ##ly , in 2016 sales for home coloring kits were close to $ 2 . 2 billion ! so you ' re probably not the only one to choose a , shall we say , unfortunate color !
thank goodness for small favors ! lo ##l why did you want to color it ? for cosmetic reasons , to cover gray ?
well , you can always color it again , only this time you should consider getting it done professionally by a hair ##dre ##sser so that she can advise you on an appropriate color !
i used black because my hair used to be all black but now it ' s all white and im barely 45 years old . my hair ##dre ##sser does a good job of coloring it for me once every 2 months
i prefer that is dyed black because it ' s more professional for me because of my line of work . if i was a musician or private business owner i would have gone with purple
most people b ##lea ##ch their hair as a trade mark . i wouldn ' t be surprised if anderson cooper hair is not natural
i think if i get tired of coloring i ' d prefer to be clean shave ##n and leave only just a mustache but the whole hair on the head shave ##n
i seen him a few years ago ! it was awesome . he ' s sold over 23 million albums in the us alone .
yes he did ! i think he changed it back though . i love the song " gin & juice " . do you have a favorite ?
oh , that was nathaniel d ##way ##ne hale right ? he ' s also a rapper and actor i remember now .
for a long time actually , but it was in the 1920s through the jazz age , that jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression .
yes ravi bis ##sam ##bha ##r is a trinidad ##ian chu ##t ##ney musician who makes jazz music !
sang ##re grande is one of his hit singles , and adds a ting ##e of indian descent music !
i agree with that , it also has a lot of different hue ##s , there ' s yellow - tinged scarlet and ve ##rmi ##lli ##on all the way to blu ##ish - crimson , how cool .
it ' s crazy how colors can influence perceptions that aren ' t obvious , like the taste of food .
yeah , it ' s called color psychology , it refers to the study of how hue ##s are a deter ##mina ##nt of human behavior .
well you were talking about it without realizing it when you mentioned red , some men even report that red outfits enhance female attractive ##ness !
neat ! orange is nice ! color even influences perceptions such as the taste of food !
yes ! and red is associated with the color to planet mars ! this happens from iron oxide !
wow ! the red pigment is interesting ! it was also used in prehistoric art .
yes ! red has existed throughout history ! the ancient egyptians colored their faces red .
i use tres ##em ##me . how about you ? do you dye your hair with hair coloring ?
me neither . what kind of hairs ##tyle or hair ##cut do you normally wear ?
i have an induction style . it allows me to wear it as short as possible without actually sha ##ving
past ##ries , as in baking . baked goods
yes , do you like baked goods , or are you a g ##lu ##ten free dieter ?
g ##lu ##ten is a protein in wheat that some people are allergic to . so many people are beginning to avoid eating bread and wheat products . which baked goods do you prefer ?
it is very bold , it is the manifestation of electromagnetic radiation with the range of wavelengths or simply called light .
red ranges from brilliant yellow - tinged scarlet , to the ve ##rmi ##lli ##on color all the way to blu ##ish - red crimson , and varies in all kinds of shade .
not entirely but we do know it is almost pri ##mo ##rdial , red pigment made from och ##re was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art . it moves our very essence .
you should try dried or fresh pasta . they ' re known as pasta sec ##ca and pasta fr ##es ##ca .
if you have a g ##lu ##ten into ##ler ##ance , you can make pasta with rice flour instead of wheat . that ' s what i do .
tomato sauce is used a lot in pasta , that ' s true , and also with meat and ve ##gg ##ies . i don ' t like it much either .
ke ##tch ##up is the best . especially heinz ke ##tch ##up . it ' s the most popular ! 60 % of the market share in the us , and 82 % in the uk .
maybe you have something in common with the the ancient egyptians and maya ##ns who use to paint their bodies and faces red for ceremonies !
i ' m really not sure , but even china held it as an important color . they used it to color early pottery .
in the renaissance , the brilliant red costumes for the rich and no ##bil ##e were dyed with ke ##rm ##es and cochin ##eal .
there ' s a lot of variation , especially between different hair colors . brown hair has high levels of a dark pigment and low levels of a pale pigment .
that ' s true . if they both have a recess ##ive gene for blonde hair , their child can be blonde !
well , it ' s pretty common in europe and the u . s . , as well as a few other places . i live in canada and see brown - haired people all the time !
well not to many because i do it with a professional hair ##dre ##sser ! so its very expensive , i had it red and orange before
a little bit but no worries everyone is doing it , in denmark is very popular 75 % of women and 18 % of men ha ##e reported using hair dye !
i would say blonde or fair hair ! everyone want to sport it that way !
a bakery in new york city . baking is an ancient activity as grains have been a staple food for thousands of years .
the profession of baking is said to have begun in ancient rome when the first mass production of bread happened .
we special ##ize in sour ##dou ##gh ! the gaul ##s were the ones who added beer fr ##oth to dough , which marked the beginning of using yeast to make bread !
my husband would probably have a heart attack too : ) but hair coloring is so popular , 75 % of women color their hair !
that ' s pretty cool ! did hair coloring damage your hair ?
nice ! i ' m glad it didn ' t
i have pretty long hair too ! my husband finds it very attractive so i ' m not planning to cut it anytime soon
yes i am , i work in a bakery
in rome , big households had their own baker ##s
lo ##l , in greece they baked almost hundreds of types of bread ##s .
so do i , especially how it has a dominant wavelength of about 625 - 740 nano ##meter ##s .
that makes sense , its a primary color which is one reason that he is so popular .
it ' s an even more beautiful color when you see the red sunset , which is caused by the ray ##leigh scattering .
so is iron oxide , which gives mars its red color .
well , the 1980s saw emergence of dance music and new wave .
yes , disco became old school

i love to make baked bread . it ' s probably the most common thing people like to make . a classic for sure ! you ever eat fresh baked bread ?
it takes some practice to make . because the heat slowly is transferred from the outside to the inside , it ' s hard to tell if they are cooked all the way through sometimes .

oh yes , i had one of those too . it was released back in 2006 so that ones a bit harder to remember for me .
i did not , i believe that came out before my time , i think i was around 6 or 7 years old when the nintendo 64 ( i think it was ) came out . i was a blue console , different from the grey ones before it i think .
i have no desire , that ' s for sure . there was a time i liked films like that . and really , the shining was a masterpiece with king as author and ku ##brick as director ! have you seen it ?
so when you read the story , did you find jack nicholson a good choice for jack - the - writer - and alcoholic who becomes caretaker of the overlook hotel ?

very true , good child care at that age is so important for the child ' s future success .

fair enough , it depends if they ' re busy and need a baby ##sit ##ter or a day ##care .

who ##oh ##oo ! that ' s going classic hair band ; - ) you ' re in the company of lots of fans - - they ' ve sold more than 100 million records worldwide !
so many of those bands did ! it ' s tough to see that their music has roots in blues , you know ? a back ##beat and a drum . . . . music !

that would make sense , as the smallest of the 3 falls is called br ##idal veil falls !
i am not sure . there are several br ##idal veil falls throughout the usa though . i know of one in wa state , and one in oregon . you can actually go to the br ##idal veil ghost town in oregon and get your wedding invitations stamped !
i live near br ##idal veil falls , oregon , that ' s how i know it exists . ghost towns do a great job of preserving period - specific artifacts , specifically architecture . they are a huge tourist attraction !
probably ! i am sure there is some tv show , similar to haunted lives : true ghost stories , about actual ghosts living in ghost towns !
but the dominant wavelength of red is approximately 625 – 740 . that ' s impressive !
i ' m sure those sunset ##s were brilliant yellow - tinged scarlet and ve ##rmi ##lli ##on . the most beautiful red .
the red sky at sunset results from ray ##leigh scattering .
i ' m not sure . red has been loved throughout history . ancient e ##gy ##tian ##s and maya ##ns coloured their faces red in ceremonies ; roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories .
well the space a baker works in is called a bakery naturally .
well we have been eating grain forever . so the activity of baking is a very old one

the romans did but greeks baked dozens and possibly hundreds of types of bread .
identical twins develop from one z ##y ##go ##te , while fra ##tern ##al develop from two different eggs
that would be correct . each egg has its own sperm cell
it seems to be - the yo ##ru ##ba people have the highest rate of twins in the world - 90 to 100 twins per 1000 live births
yes it is believed it might because they have a high consumption of a type of ya ##m which stimulate ##s eggs to be released from each o ##vary
i ' ve never had it ! i love pasta with bo ##log ##nese sauce , that ' s with meat .
it does sound good though . what other pasta dishes do you like ? las ##agne ?
oh that is so good . but talk about bad for you ! i recently read that there are more than 300 shapes and varieties of pasta .
yeah is also a song by usher .
there are large numbers of pasta variants . i like pan ##ce ##tta and par ##s ##ni ##ps in my pasta best !
bo ##log ##nese sauce is a meat based sauce . that one tastes very good , you should definitely have that too .
it is very popular around the world !
go ##uda cheese is dated all the way back from 118 ##4 that makes it the oldest recorded cheese in the world
the cheese is named after a dutch city . interesting fact ! it wasn ##t made there , but it was traded there and very popular known historically so they named it after that city .
yes , it was def . named after the dutch city . they had a way of trading , called hand ##je ##kla ##p . they would clap each others hands while shouting prices .
the process of editing can involve correction , conde ##ns ##ation , organization , and many other modifications in order to perform accurate and complete work .
when it comes to editing images , many graphic software programs are used , such as vector graphics editors , ras ##ter graphics editors , and 3d model ##ers .
editing involves creative skills , human relations , and a precise set of methods .
yes , there are a couple of types . there ' s identical ( they develop from on z ##y ##go ##te which splits ) and fra ##tern ##al , which means they develop from separate eggs . quite fascinating .
in central africa there are 18 to 30 sets of twins per 1000 - quite a bit more than we have !
not sure . the yo ##ru ##ba people of nigeria have an even greater incidence of twin births . it is speculated that is because they eat a lot of a specific type of ya ##m which may stimulate the o ##var ##ies . kind of bizarre , but who knows ?
i ' m no expert i just know in culinary we did a week on italian cuisine which was reference in 115 ##4 .
i like mines with extra sauce and sausage ##s and shrimp when cooking my specific pasta what ' s yours ?
no you can ' t that is a classic fresh or dried pasta can make spaghetti and meat ##balls taste awesome lo ##l .
i bet you ' re right ! maybe no eating di ##sor ##fer lo ##l , just water weight for giant water ##mel ##ons .
i wouldn ' t go as far as saying i need to do a 12 step program for food addict ##s but i for sure need to pad ##lock the cookie jar . i was slightly under ##weight but that ' s not a concern anymore . i ' ve gain 15 this past year .
it seriously is . i think us humans can addicted to anything , but that ' s my opinion . over eating also causes addict ##ive behaviors . i personally need self discipline , it would benefit my family too
i ' ll admit , i have an addict ##ive personality anyway . i have to be careful with most i do . i think my personality traits are just that way
absolutely , the history extends even to the ancient egyptians and maya ##ns , who colored their faces red during ceremonies !
not only so many meanings , but so many different hue ##s itself , ranging from yellow - tinged scarlet and ve ##rmi ##lli ##on to blu ##ish - red crimson even !
absolutely , red has quite a psychological affect , that ' s probably why st ##im ##ula ##nt pills are generally red or orange .
yes i like shame ##less . william macy is hilarious ! i also like homeland , billions and the affair . you watch any of those ?
hbo has been around since 1972 ! what shows do you like on hbo ? my favorite was the wire .
i have been trying to catch up on game of throne ##s , i am on season 4 i think . can ' t believe it is ended in 2019 .
my favorite character was ned stark , then they killed him . i heard he comes back later but i haven ' t gotten there yet .
i have higher levels of a pigment called eu ##mel ##ani ##n
i ' m caucasian so this hair color is common in my ethnic group
eu ##mel ##ani ##n is the pigment that makes hair darker , so the more eu ##mal ##ini ##n that is present the darker the hair color
the levels can change naturally over time
car ##bs scare me but i love pasta . or italian cuisine ' s , they are a food typically from italy , i ' d love to go there !

speaking of small places , there is a work creation nonfiction that was published 1988 called small place . maybe a book ? do you like to read books ?
they are definitely among my favourite sports cars , although i would prefer to drive an electric car . what ' s your favourite ?
electric cars have electric motors compared to gas powered ones , but that ' s the only difference i can think of . plus , you don ' t have to fill up all the time .
ha ##h , if your company is willing to pay for an electric car , you should definitely go for it . would probably save you a ton of money in the long run . better for the environment too because of the batteries and solar panels .
i think they generally have plug ##s outside in parking lots and that sort of thing . either that or you can get a wall socket in your home .
his debut album was called dogg ##y style , and it was totally awesome !
he sure did ! it was called " murder was the case " and it was amazing !
he was with death row records for quite awhile , from 1993

well american par ##mes ##an is not so hard , but real italian one is really hard , gran ##ular cheese , full of taste also
italian cuisine is awesome , italian food is the best food in the world for me , italian cuisine got its roots from antiquity !
well , the twin birth rate in the us rose from 18 . 9 to 33 . 3 for every 1 , 000 births between 1980 and 2009
i ' m not sure but the yo ##ru ##ba people have the highest twin rate in the world possibly because they eat a ya ##m that contains a natural ph ##yt ##oes ##tro ##gen
when each twin is fe ##rti ##lized by its own sperm cell , it is called fra ##tern ##al
you must not be a female . . lo ##l i mean brown varies from light to dark , but i prefer blonde
i find it interesting that brown hair is thicker than blonde but red hair is even thicker .
nice ! australian ab ##ori ##gin ##es and mel ##ane ##sian ##s are mainly brown too .
wow i never knew that ! japan ? ? all i know is my scandinavian ancestors say br ##un not brown especially rural scotland .
well i have heard in the beginning , various hindus wrote 7 more or less in one stroke as a curve that looks like an upper ##case j
well in school i learned both modern arab forms influenced the european form , a two - stroke character consisting of a horizontal upper line joined at its right to a line going down to the bottom left corner ,
im not sure about that but as is the case with the european g ##ly ##ph , the cha ##m and khmer g ##ly ##ph for 7 also evolved to look like their g ##ly ##ph for 1
i always wanted to be a baker , like as a profession . i think i most enjoy making deserts though !
no , although some of them are industrial ##ized , bei ##n ##f automated by machines , so there is not much actual baking , i still think it would be fun though
yes , there is a lot of training , especially with the safety aspects of the job !
it is a primary color in the r ##gb color model , and it ' s also in the cm ##yk color model . it complement ##s cy ##an .
well the ancient egyptians and maya ##ns were known to color their faces red for ceremonies , and roman general would color their bodies when they were victorious .
in the renaissance days it was used on the costumes for nobility and the wealthy , so it seems that it ' s been around an extremely long time for different uses .
my name is john , have you heard of caroline ##s on broadway ? caroline ##s on broadway is a venue for stand - up comedy
it is one of the most popular comedy clubs in the united states .
some of the headlined at caroline ##s include patrice o ' neal , larry david , jim norton , greer barnes .
it ' s all about comedy .
i think its the most popular cheese worldwide , i like making it with mac ##aro ##ni , i like homemade mac & cheese
i really like pizza too , especially with go ##uda , its a traditional special ##ity guaranteed dish in italy

even a greek historian from long ago talked about celtic people dye ##ing their hair blonde almost white
nothing beats going outside for a jo ##g , getting that good sunlight and fresh air . but physical fitness isn ' t achieved through exercise alone , fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition . do you eat health ##ily ?
oh define ##at ##ly , getting enough protein in your diet is essential to good muscle health and the bodies ability to function efficiently and effectively
for weight loss , anything that gets the heart rate up works . you don ' t need to build muscle to lose weight , simple jumping jack ##s or high knees will su ##ffi ##ce and also helps your body to resist h ##yp ##oki ##net ##ic diseases
personally , i just take a multi - vitamin , usually they include vitamin ##s , minerals , fiber , fatty acids , or amino acids . but you don ' t really need these as long as you have a good diet with lots of variety !
you are right the shades and variations of red does have it meaning in different selections just like cautious behaviors etc .
i didn ' t know that is why they wore red great fact to know . did you that ancient egyptians colored their face red to celebrate victories .
i re ##me ##ber that my pastor preached about it in bible study , people in china also is fond of red because they use it to color pottery for their great big walls and gates of palaces .

oh yeah she would ! the 1962 ferrari 250 gt ##o became the most expensive car in history in 2012 !
well i think if you want one that is older then a few years you will have to learn that manual transmission deal ! ! i do believe that the last couple of modern models have the option for an automatic as a form of custom ##ization .
yes i do , interesting fact there are about 13 million cows in the dairy farm industry
yes that ' s correct dairy cows are bred specifically for producing insane amounts of milk .
it ' s actually an interesting concept the dairy cow has to give birth to one calf per year so they can still make milk .
yes . its developed from roots in blues and rag ##time
really , blues is a rhythm and blue and rock and roll .
jazz is seen by many as america ' s classical music

i really like baking cr ##ois ##sant ##s . they are layered with butter , rolled , and placed on a sheet .
they are good as well . you can make with with ground almond ##s , coconut , and sometimes other nuts
i would say the most common ones such as pie ##s or tar ##ts . they are good for new ##bies
it depends . i would try a cu ##star ##d pie . you pretty much just mix milk , eggs , sugar and vanilla and pour it into a pie crust
yes , i see that two specific people in belgium spearheaded the beginning of jazz as well . it sounds like jazz was started in plenty of places . is jazz still a strong genre today ?
that ' s amazing , i wonder where it will go in the future . there ' s a movement called free jazz to attempt to return jazz to it ' s imp ##rov roots .
and jazz fusion emerged in the 1960s with a combination of other genres . i don ' t think people appreciate jazz being so different as it has evolved and they ' d like to take it back to the roots .
that is true , the united states especially has a huge amount of genres for all tastes . it ' s one of the the largest music markets in the world .
why yes it is a primary color in the r ##gb color model and the cm ##yk color model . it is the complementary color of cy ##an

i can recall him being in the movie baby boy . and also after leaving death row rec ##ods , snoop signed with no limit records . he recorded his next three albums there . and i agree that still is impressive . i am inspired
yes i do ! i love pasta so much that i learned all about it ! i recently read that pasta was first created in 115 ##4 in sicily ! that ' s a long time !
me too ! i love my pasta with alfredo or tomato sauce ! pasta is made in 310 different forms . that ' s almost one for every day of the year !
i know that it was traditionally made by hand , but thank goodness we don ' t have to do that anymore . unless we want to of course . both fresh and dried pasta ##s are readily available in supermarkets . it ' s so much more convenient , don ' t you think ?
well , their custom ##ization can do that for you but you may have trouble with your local laws !
i don ' t have a favorite . i consider harley - davidson and all motor ##cy ##les them death wish machines / donor mobile ##s !
yep , ask me anything harley - davidson inc .

oh that does sound kind of good . google will help you out i ' m sure , and will let you create a nice baked bread with a firm dry crust and a soft , pepper ##oni center , yu ##m !
it is also the ability to perform aspects of sports , occupations and daily activities .
one can get it through through proper nutrition , moderate - vigorous physical exercise , and sufficient rest .
one can say that it is the quality or state of being fit .
i was a tennis player but that is bad on the knees . physical fitness is generally thought of as proper nutrition , exercise and an adequate rest period .
yes ! before the industrial revolution , people thought of fitness as the ability to get through the day ' s activities and survive ! lo ##l
today , fitness is defined as the state of " being fit " as to whatever that means ! lo ##l i don ' t think i fit that category ! lo ##l
today , a modern definition of being fit either means a person or machine ' s ability to do it ' s thing and to be able to cope with various situations .
wow i have heard of making it by hand with flour and water and eggs but thought it was extremely hard
i imagine is fresh pasta is much better than dried pasta . how do you make it ?
is it hard to make the pasta into various shapes ?
very cool . italian food is the best - it has so much flavor and it is the most popular and copied in the world
i completely agree . the older that i get , the more afraid of them i become . one group of clown ##s that i find frightening is the group insane clown posse . have you heard of them ?
that ' s true , they are a music group . jug ##gal ##os are freak ##y along with the movie it . i can ' t believe that people were dressing up like evil clown ##s back in 2016 and hiding near schools . wouldn ' t that be freak ##y to encounter one at night ?
i did see it . i think i remember seeing it on tv right when it came out in 1986 . that movie still freaks me out to this day . i haven ' t seen the new version yet . have you ?
sounds good . if i get too scared watching a movie about a real life killer clown , i may have to pop on the simpsons and watch a bit of k ##rus ##ty . matt gr ##oe ##ning did a great job when he created that character for the show !
yeah i think so . its international and mu ##lt - genre
they are really helpful in industry , connecting publishers to distributors etc
i can ' t find that information but i do know it is a 4 day event
it is held in july
me too , i just love to form it into cool shapes and top it with sweet ic ##ing for dessert .
ah yes fond ##ant is so simple , i make it with sugar and water stabilized with gel ##atin and a pinch of g ##ly ##cer ##ine . its an old recipe indeed .
in french in french it means " melting " , maybe they were thinking of marsh ##mal ##low ##s when the got the name ha ##ha .
i ' m not sure . but , it was founded by enzo ferrari back in 1939 , and they built their first car in 1940
it has been rest ##ructured back in 2015 , making ferrari n . v .
oh , yes . back in 2014 , they were rated the world ' s most powerful brand . they ' re amazing !
i have , a few cases are caused primarily by genes , end ##oc ##rine disorders and some just happen over time .
i think i might get a gym membership , on average , obe ##se people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts so i will have to work hard
my doctor said changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments . so we are going to try really hard .
the substance that gives these peppers their sp ##ici ##ness when eaten is called caps ##ai ##cin .
it is used in a variety of different cuisine ##s ! one example is korean cuisine , where they use go ##uch ##uj ##ang , which is fe ##rm ##ented red chili paste .
a cool fact is that half of the global supply of chili peppers is coming from china , which is the world ' s largest producer .
they ' ve been around for a long time . since 750 ##0 bce , they ' ve been a part of the human diet .
sometimes in the western world people draw a horizontal stroke through the middle of the 7 , but you never see that on a keyboard .
i guess it helps to distinguish a 7 from a 1 , if you have bad handwriting like i do !
quite a few cultures , including hindus , have written the 7 in similar ways to how we do it . the hindus originally wrote it like an inverted j .
i know , right ? and apparently the arabs ' contribution was to make the longer line of the 7 straight ##er , and to make it more rec ##ti ##line ##ar , or angular , like we do .
in the sky , yes . in general red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light next to orange .
yes ! it ' s the primary color in the r ##gb color model as well . and it is the complementary color of cy ##an : )
yeah ! cy ##an is a greenish blue ! it ' s somewhere on the spectrum next to red !
fun fact : the color red is at the end of the visible spectrum ? it is next to orange and opposite violet .
yep , you are right . it is a primary color and the compliment ##ary color of cy ##an .
actually , it is a greenish - blue
it may seem a bit complicated in distinguishing the hue , but it all comes down to the sat ##uration and lu ##min ##osity of the object that is being described .
grains have been popular for a thousand or more years , so baking is a very old practice .
by the sixth century ad , the greeks would use oven ##s heated by wood fires and communities baked in a big ol ' communal oven .
in rome , a few centuries later , the first mass production of bread ##s was done , and that ' s when they said the bakery profession really got started .
there are special sham ##poo ##s and condition ##ers . won ' t be hard to find them in the store because hair coloring products are a 1 . 9 billion dollar business in the u . s . !
they likely used natural dye ##s , which can be from vegetables and plant sources like roots , bark , leaves , berries and wood . you can also find dye ##s in fungi and li ##chen ##s !
some do but thankfully there ' s the ts ##ca or toxic substances control act which helps protect consumers against dangerous chemicals .
it was founded by george dayton , their headquarters are in minneapolis minnesota .
well target is the second largest retailer so it would be hard to avoid , it ' s behind wal ##mart . i ' ve shop ##ped at both .
i prefer target , wal ##mart has been accused of racial and gender discrimination and target has always been an lgbt ally .
a long time ago people considered fitness to be the ability to carry out your day ' s duties without getting very tired .
i agree , manual labor was the primary form of completing physical work , so nowadays people try to make up for the lack of physical jobs by exercising .
body ##weight exercise is supposed to improve strength , endurance , flexibility and concentration . it uses your own body weight rather than weights or machines .
i ' m not sure , but it is definitely cost efficient since it only uses your body ' s abilities such as bending , twisting , pushing , pulling , squat ##ting and balancing .
i have never been to comic - con . i understand it hosts both entertainment and comic genre .
i have not . the comic con is a four day event held at the san diego convention center .
i do not , however if its large enough to hold this four day event , it must be pretty large !
it ' s crazy that the event lasts for 4 days every summer since 2003 . that is a lot of content and fun it seems like !
i was interested to find out that on the wednesday prior to the official opening , guests for all 4 days can attend a " preview night " and walk the exhibit hall before the convention begins . how cool !
i think so , i think that ##s the point , to give them a sneak peak . all i know is i ' d love to go to the sd ##cc sometime , i may have to visit the website for comic con international to get more information .
i have never been near one ! lo ##l i know they live in warm , subtropical and tropical waters . i think i would be terrified ! lo ##l
i know they are protected in international waters by the convention of migratory species of wild animals . i think they are very vulnerable if they get close to shore .
i ' m not sure but i don ' t believe they sting . i was amazed to find out their ge ##station period last over a year !
same , i enjoy east coast more , but west coast was great too . dr . dr ##e ' s production was always amazing .
no doubt . as far as east coast , " ill ##matic " by nas is my favorite album ever . that was what really got me into old school rap
another great one for sure . that time period was special , i also love " enter the wu - tang ( 36 chambers ) " by wu - tang clan
amazing track ! some of the individual stuff from those guys is awesome too , like " only built 4 cuban lin ##x " by rae ##k ##won
blood red is a pretty nice color of red , i prefer the darker reds like crimson as well .
red wines are pretty nice , i can be a little pick ##y with them at times though .
definitely ! more often than not i do prefer white wines .
the name of the color model r ##gb derives from the primary colors being used red , green , and blue
yes , colors are a main part of how we judge the emotion of things as well . the egyptians and maya ##ns also coloured their faces red in ceremonies . even roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victory
the sky at sunset can have deep reds in it which is due to ray ##leigh scattering
i ' m kind of torn , i think probably they aren ' t , but the hard and dry texture probably helps clean their teeth , at least according to some manufacturers .
yeah that ' s probably true , it ' s crazy to think that dog biscuits have been around since the roman times , where they were called " dog ' s bread . "
yeah we certainly have a close relationship with dogs . interesting ##ly , the bread was made from bran and it was called par ##runa .
sometimes when i day ##dre ##am , i wish i was sha ##zam , the marvel comic book superhero .
if i was a superhero , i would be able to fight sava ##k , the iranian intelligence agency once run by ho ##sse ##in far ##dou ##st .
the last film i watched was about operation " t ##pa ##ja ##x " , about the coup in 1953 that over ##th ##rew democracy in iran and installed the shah .
while it is not a movie , i did see " the co ##on " , the second episode of the thirteenth season of south park
" the co ##on " is about a superhero who grows jealous of another superhero , my ##ster ##ion .
yes , baking is very old because grains have been used for mill ##enia .
well using yeast is only a recent thing .
not sure but can tell you the ancient romans were mass producing bread .
i do whatever keeps my body in shape . fitness is known as the quality of being fit and being in that state of mind .
usually 4 days a week . the modern definition of fitness is labeled as the ab ##il ##ti ##y is a human or machines specific function or ho ##listic of adapt ##ability to cope with various incidents or situations .
not an easy task but determination will pay off . physical fitness is achieved by eating proper nutrition , rest and various rigorous exercise .
yes , dr . dr ##e is the current ceo of aftermath entertainment .
i know it is a single which was released on july 4 , 2000 .
i don ' t know who else aftermath represents but i do know that dr . dr ##e was also a co - owner of death row records .
they are very simple , as they are a no ##odle of un ##lea ##ven ##ed dough .
even if they are throughout many cultures , pasta are primarily italian cuisine .
true , they are made of water , eggs , and flour mostly .
yeah it ' s so hard to make them since you have to form them into sheets and kn ##ead the dough .
when i was young , cake in an easy - ba ##ke oven
i really like making angel food cakes now
you use cream of tar ##tar .
it is a salt from wine ##making
well child care is very important in developing a child ' s emotional and social development ,
that is not a very good salary and probably representative of the gender pay gap in the u . s .
yes , i agree . now they ' re are a lot of stay - at - home dad ##s . you know , where the dad doesn ' t work and the mom does .
i didn ' t know that . in ireland and new zealand child care is referred to as " cr ##ech ? "
i would say it is red hair since only 1 - 2 % of the population has it . it ' s a shame because it is very pretty .
it has to do with pigment . so high levels of eu ##mel ##ani ##n makes the hair dark while lower levels of ph ##eo ##mel ##ani ##n make the hair lighter .
i ' m not sure i would think genetics . people that have brown hair are usually called brunette ' s . do you get called that ?
i don ' t think they have a name for them . my hair gets thick too , and fair hair is not as thick and not as much as red heads .
yes , it ' s a town located in northern italy .
the company was founded by enzo ferrari in 1939 , and has always built race cars , as it is out of alfa romeo ' s race division .
no , they separated in 2015 .
i like more of the color blue it goes well with my eyes lo ##l plus it is close to violet and green on the spectrum which i like as well .
i ' ll have to pass for that reason the sight of blood makes me que ##nch i like red because of apples and straw ##berries though lo ##l .
i like the green apples as well have you tried the fuji apples they are very round about 75 ##mm in diameter and very juicy and sweet .
i never knew it made a difference in the summer i eat them anytime , thousands of years ago they was grown in asia and europe year round though .
not really it can be troubles ##ome . fatigue is not due to st ##ren ##uous ongoing ex ##ert ##ion , is not much relieved by rest ,
it is chronic fatigue syndrome . no medications or procedures have been approved
it is unknown what causes it . evidence suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy and a gradual increase in activity
i have read that the medication ri ##nta ##to ##lim ##od helps
obesity is when someone ' s body mass index is over the ranged defined as over ##weight . you get the b ##mi by dividing weight by square of height .
definitely ! it is commonly caused by lack of activity , excessive food intake and genetics .
i would agree ! it can be prevented by making changes in social and personal choices . we love our fast food in america ! lo ##l
obviously we lack self control ! lo ##l the easiest way to treat obesity is to change your diet and increase your exercise routine .
he was the voice in the movie turbo .
it ' s a dream ##works animation in 2013 as the voice of sm ##oo ##ve move the snail , lo ##l .
not for sure as there are lots of popular ones : sh ##rek , madagascar , kung fu panda , and the boss baby . also many more good movies .
that seems like a decent show . is it about the original super ##girl kara z ##or - el ?
superman is one of dc comics most beloved heroes !
have you seen the dc comics show , superman : the animated series ? they handle his character very well .
superman was sold to dc in 1938 . he has been around a w ##hil . e
i can see that ! clown ##s are very good at entertaining large audiences , even at a distance !
oh , i doubt that ! ! do you wear the typical " red clown " type of costume with a colorful wig and clothing , exaggerated foot ##wear and distinctive makeup ?
it ' s no wonder after the crazy clown sighting ##s of 2016 ! by mid - october , evil clown sighting ##s and attacks were reported in nearly every single us state !
it ' s a shame that a few bad apples tried to ruin clown ##s for everyone ! clown ##s have been around since the early 1800s and i ' m sure back then they weren ' t trying to terri ##fy people !
the levels and color phases of brown range from light brown to almost black .
strands of hairs are usually thicker than those of fair hair but not as much as those with red hair .
it can be characterized with higher levels of dark pigment eu ##mel ##ani ##n and low levels of the pale pigment ph ##eon ##ome ##lani ##n .
i ' ve tried green ##ies , i think they are similar . would dent ##ast ##ix help with a tooth ##ache
i may look into that . i wonder what is causing the pain and inflammation . injury ? tooth decay ?
maybe he just needs to practice better oral hygiene
it is a 4 day long event from thursday to sunday .
initially it was called the golden state comic book convention when founded by richard alf , she ##l do ##rf , ken k ##ru ##eger , and mike tow ##ry .
they usually feature a large variety of panels and activities as well as attendees dressed in co ##sp ##lay .
i do strength training which is a type of exercise that specializes in using resistance to induce muscular contraction to build my strength up .
yes i do , they are used to oppose the force generated by my muscles through con ##centric or eccentric contraction ##s ! .
sometimes i do card ##io . i like to to pl ##yo ##metric ##s or " jump training " exercises which ex ##ert ##s maximum force in short intervals of time , with the goal of increasing my power .
the company was established in 1963 as showtime / the movie channel inc .
i don ' t remember but the showtime brand is used by a number of channels around the world but primarily refers to the group of 8 channels in u . s .
in 1985 warner sold its half - interest in the company to via ##com , that is now its sole owner /
i don ' t have the numbers with me . but in 1988 the company was renamed showtime networks inc .
one of my favorite types of wine is cab ##ern ##et sa ##u ##vi ##gnon . which is one of the most popular and recognized red var ##ie ##tal ##s .
mer ##lot is deemed to be " softer " and " flesh ##y " than cab ##ern ##et which is usually sm ##oki ##er and deeper .
i ' m not too verse ##d on whites . i do know that another popular variety of red is pin ##ot noir , and the grapes are grown in cooler locations .
te ##mp ##rano means " early " in spanish so the grapes are picked earlier than most other grapes .
i think i ' ve heard of that , so i think not . well caroline ##s on broadway is one of the most recognized stand - up comedy clubs in the whole us .
yeah , he ' s a little arrogant and rude but i like what i ' ve seen of him . tons of people have performed at caroline ##s on broadway , like louis ck and jerry se ##in ##feld .
i ' ve watched very little ufc , personally . but yeah there ' s been jim norton and bill burr there too .
well , obesity causes diseases like corona ##ry heart diseases , which can lead to mortality .
well on a personal level there is diet in exercise , but you could also support organizations like the biggest loser
there is rising prevalence in obesity children . sadly i think the answer may be that people were raised into obesity .
i am not sure but red is a primary color .
yes , the r ##gb color model is an additive color model .
i think so , the main purpose of the r ##gb color model is for the sensing , represent ##ai ##on and display of images in electronic systems .
i am not sure , but red is a important color in china .
no , i guess ##i was just general ##ising the term but they ba ##ke an assortment of things in a bakery .
you name it , baking tray ##s , bowls , mixer ##s , oven and the list goes on as there are numerous tools used .
and its a very old profession since grains have been a staple food for millennia
i think since a lot of cultures have their own styles and variations in costumes when it comes to clown ##s , some may be creep ##ier than others .
the way they entertain is usually from a distance by design , which is especially suited for large audiences . the farther away the better .
yes , and though you usually find clown ##s as part of circus ##es , there are some that can become their own solo act . a great way to confront it .
joseph grim ##aldi played one of the first mainstream clown ##s back in the day . he was the origin ##ator of the white make up they use .
well if you buy an italian version it runs about 300 ##k , ferrari ##s are manufactured here where i live in mara ##nell ##o .
mara ##nell ##o is a little town in the region of emilia - roma ##gna in northern italy , about 18 km from mode ##na , the population here is 17 , 165 as of 2013 .
im not too sure but ever since fiat s . p . a . acquired 50 % of ferrari in back in 1969 they really expanded its stakes a bit and added about 20 more cars to their line - ups . if you seen a fiat on the road it was made by the fe ##rar ##ri people .
seven is the number after 6 but before 8 .
the hindus used to write the number 7 so it would look like a j vertically inverted .
well after the hindus , the arabs made the number longer than straight .
yes , the hindus started it in the beginning .
they gave him such a strong moral compass , which luckily for everyone else , made him good instead of evil lo ##l
i have not , it would be amazing to own an action comics # 1 , it came out in 1938 !
one sold for more than $ 3 million dollars in 2014 , it was a 9 . 0 grade
i wish i could call myself a baker , that would be an awesome job
well i am sure with the industrial ##ization of baking , they hire fewer people and use machines in huge factories
it is sad , most food we eat is so processed , it is not hard to use an oven and ba ##ke food in it
i know they use it to help reduce our risk of food ##borne illnesses and preserve fresh ##ness , i wonder what the effects of it on us are ?
it can vary in shades of very light to almost black . mine is a lighter brown . what is yours ?
brown hair people tend to have thicker hair than those of fair hair but not as thick as red heads . i sometimes will color mine a shade of red .
i do know that brown hair people are often referred to as brunette ##s which is a feminine term . maybe that means their are more women who are brown haired ? ? ?
also brown hair is very common apparent ##y in the western world
yes , it is known as a lucky number in western countries !
yes i do , the eastern arabs actually developed the character for 7 by using an upper ##case v and rotating it
you can also write 7 with a horizontal line in the middle , but this is usually excluded in computer font ##s
those who want to avoid g ##lu ##ten can eat pasta ##s made from rice flour , but i prefer wheat .
yes i like ne ##ap ##oli ##tan sauce as well , compared to alfredo sauce ##s .
i ' m not as big a fan of latin american cuisine , because i don ' t like maize - based dishes .
it might also be the spices used in latin american cuisine that i don ' t like . maybe they are just too heavy .
yes , the practice of changing hair color is really strange though .
does it ? i really don ' t think that cosmetic hair color makes it turn gray .
yeah , if anything it is meant to cover gray or white hair .
i guess i ' ll have to use it when my hair is turning gray or white .
el ##on mu ##sk is the founder of space ##x which is short for the space exploration company . his falcon heavy rocket could take us to mars .
well i hope you don ' t bring too much luggage . the falcon heavy rocket can only get 8 , 000 kilograms to geo ##station ##ary orbit .
well we don ' t exactly have access to a space elevator . although that would be a fairly convenient way to avoid needing such big rockets .
inter ##plane ##tary space ##flight normally requires a suitable launch window . i ' ll have to check my model solar system that i made for 3rd grade science fair .
it would surprise you to know that superman was the fig ##ment of then high school students imagination writer jerry siegel and artist joe shu ##ster ,
ye ##a , the two young school boys sold superman to detective comics which became dc comics , in 1938 .
the company did their homework as they featured superman in appeared in various radio serials , newspaper and other like media ##s
of course , the rest is history because superman became a superhero arch ##ety ##pe and establish its prima ##cy within the american comic book .
i ' m not sure ! maybe a medium brown shade . i need to cover my grey hair !
thanks ! we ' ll see i guess ! i ' m trying to decide if i ' m brave enough to try to dye it myself at home , or if i should get it professionally done by a hair ##dre ##sser .
that ' s true . maybe i ' ll make an appointment ! i recently found out that 75 % of women and 18 % of men have dyed their hair . isn ' t that crazy ? !
yes , in 2014 ferrari was rated the world ' s most powerful brand . if only i could afford one , ha ##ha
i have no idea , but it must be a lot ! the founder enzo ferrari founded the company in 1939 , so think of the inflation !
exactly , they must be pretty he ##ft ##y in price since unlike other similar companies , the death of the founder didn ' t destroy it .
speaking of hot ##ness , i am much attracted to that fictional superhero wonder woman . that is what i call beauty
indeed . superman with its success , has pretty much established its prima ##cy into comic books and mostly is central
jerry siegel who created superman was very adventurous in giving this character such powers . none others can match to him
indeed . i am also curious about magnet ##o from x - men . he also seems to be powerful with metal control ability
i also use baking in combination with grill ##ing to make a hybrid type of barbecue . do you mix up cooking techniques ?
um , i ' ve never cooked prince before . but like i said , i like to use grill ##ing also which is dry heat applied to food .
yeah , but back to the topic , baking is related to bar ##be ##cu ##ing because the oven is similar to a smoke pit .
it is at the end of the spectrum light . it sits next to orange and is opposite of violet .
the red color in blood actually comes from something called hem ##og ##lo ##bin
i also read that red is one of the first colors used in prehistoric art
its also an important color in china . they used it to color pottery with .
well you can do it yourself , or you can go to a professional hair ##dre ##sser .
no but is ex ##tre ##ml ##y popular . almost 75 % of women dye their hair !
not only women , but 185 of men too !
sob ##riety is also considered to be the natural state of human being given at birth
well in a treatment setting , sob ##riety is achieved goal of independence from consuming alcohol .
in abs ##tine ##nce , residual effects of alcohol consumption can pre ##cl ##ude sob ##riety
it ' s fire engine red ! ferrari was actually named the most powerful brand in 2014 .
ferrari was founded in 1939 by enzo ferrari .
i ' m really not sure but ferrari was previously owned by fiat but in 2016 , became a separate company .
probably not considering the the 1962 ferrari 250 gt ##o became the most expensive car in history .
yep , it ' s on broadway between 49th and 50th street .
caroline hirsch herself opened her eponymous cab ##ere ##t in chelsea , in 81 ' .
dennis miller has performed there before . he was born in 1953 .
they may charge a lot . she was so successful she had to move to a larger venue to south street sea ##port .
i like ling ##uin ##i too . pasta is fairly easy to make , usually just using flour and eggs or water .
i am an okay cook , but i usually just go with dry pasta , which is also known as pasta sec ##ca .
i will usually pair it with tomato sauce . lately i ' ve started making my own sauce . each pasta dish is defined by the type of no ##odle , sauce , and cooking style .
i ' ll have to try making it sometime .
they ' re an italian sports car manufacturer ! anything else you wanna know ?
yes , it was named after the man that founded the company , enzo ferrari .
no i haven ' t , but i ' d love to visit sometime . especially to see where they built their first car in the alfa romeo race division .
well it is a 4 day event held every summer . you can meet your favorite characters and creators of many different comic related things .
i ' m not sure actually but i know it ' s a lot . comic con international also hosts two other conventions called wonder ##con and the alternative press expo .
yes you can there are many who do ! also , pre registered guests can attend a pre - event to give them an opportunity to walk the exhibit hall before it gets crowded !
not really . just make sure you have fun and be safe . enjoy your time at the sd ##cc when you get to go !
it was made in 2016 . its different from other alien invasion films where aliens come just to en ##sl ##ave or destroy humans ,
it was produced by several production companies . it deals al ##ot with current affairs and the threats we face from other countries .
the film stars amy adams and jeremy ren ##ner . alien invasion movies was commonly a metaphor during the cold war directed at fears of the soviet union .
i was talking about alien invasion movies not the film . historically , it dealt with fears during the cold war between the usa and soviet russia in the 40 ##s .
that reminds me of that song , " i love rock and roll " by joan jett & the black ##heart ##s , now it will be stuck in my head lo ##l .
wanna know ? i stay fact - ed up on the classics . it was first written by alan merrill ( the arrows ) but the ##version most of us all know ( black ##heart ##s ) 1982 all the way
i am a big fan of classic rock too . something about electric guitars , a double bass guitar or string guitar . . . makes my soul feel at home
it can be biological or infections or genetic . tests must be performed to find out the cause .
the ultimate diagnosis is based on a person ' s symptoms .
there is no sure that is approved in the us as of now . it would take just a lifestyle change i think .
with all the var ##ities of grapes and strains there are a lot of types , but they are all so good , i am not sure if i have a favorite !
yeah there is certainly a portion of people that are more informal and do it for recreation in a much less analytical way
i have heard they are known for the dessert wine vin santo , which is made from local grapes
i do like red , but i never was a fan of champagne , or sparkling wine . there are even laws around label ##ling a drink champagne which is interesting
if they don ' t use a flour - base what do they use in those food products ?
well i was meaning more if ingredients . some people make their own dog food .
hopefully they don ' t lead to any all ##er ##gies with the dogs diet .
yeah i do mine at home also . this is a neat fact i never knew , at home coloring in the us reached 1 . 9 billion in 2011 !
yeah that ##s crazy to think of how that affects the salon ##s . when i was younger i always thought salon ##s made really well , as im older , im finding out that they are not as well as i thought they were .
yeah di ##y is the now go to thing for everyone , so many youtube videos to show you how to do everything including hair coloring . i personally don ##t want to spend hundreds on hair coloring and i know how to do it at home myself .
yu ##p , it has been around for a while . interesting though is that it was 1947 before the first " ferrari " was built .
yes , it is . in fact in 2014 they were rated the worlds most powerful brand .
you would be interested in the fact that the 1962 ferrari 250 gt ##o is the most expensive car in history .
one sold in 2014 for $ 38 , 115 , 000 . 00 . i ' m not sure of the color , my apologies .
day ##care is the caring for and supervision of a child or children
child care is a broad topic
early child care is an equally important and often overlooked component of child development
u ##ually child ##ten are taken care by parents
what i like about red is that it has dominant wavelength . blue mainly indicates calm ##ness and rest
in color science , it is the physical property that defines the intensity of light beaming to create that specific color that we see
they are measured in nano ##meter ##s . usually calculating the frequency of wave repetition ##s . high frequency means high intensity , thus dominance
to cover my gray hair and have more blond
low levels of the dark pigment eu ##mel ##ani ##n
eu ##mel ##ani ##n is a type of mel ##ani ##n found in hair f ##oll ##icles
its red ! next to orange and opposite violet
red is mine like i said earlier . violet is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light
its a primary color with an approximately wavelength of 625 – 740 nano ##met ##res .
in fra ##tern ##al twins , each twin is fe ##rti ##lized by its own sperm cell
the birth ##rate of twins in the us rose 76 % from 1980 to 2009
i have seen quite a few . non related look alike ##s that aren ' t twins are called do ##ppel ##gang ##ers . i have a few of them ,
i bet that has been studied . north america and europe have rates of 9 to 16 twin births per 1 , 000 births .
yes ! do you have any favorite songs ? i like " nature boy "
neat ! i have never heard anita baker , but i know that her career spanned 1983 - 2002
i have never heard that . do you like ray charles ?
honestly , w ##hey protein is unnecessary unless you are a top level at ##hel ##ete , mc ##t oil and natural proteins are much more bio ##ava ##ila ##ble for energy

the ferrari 250 gt ##o became the most expensive car in history in 2012 .
it gets its high price because only 39 250 gt ##os were made between 1962 and 1964 .
definitely ! it involves a lot of baking and boiling , especially with pasta involved .

yeah that is certainly what you go there for . in fact , during peak tourist times more than 6 million cubic feet of water goes over the falls .
i can imagine it would be sometimes , maybe you should visit the smaller br ##idal veil falls .
target was founded in the 60s in one of the suburbs of minneapolis by the dayton co ##or ##por ##ation . mark dayton ( of the same family ) is now our govern ##er !
he didn ' t personally found it , but his family are minnesota business ty ##co ##ons and he is now one of the wealthiest people in out state . his family ' s wealth helped his political career .
yes they certainly are powerful ! however he actually has a pretty good approval rating as far as i know , he also has helped our state budget stay in surplus though his policies .
exactly , there are a lot of those people around these days , like george w bush , who served as govern ##er of texas and then president after his father did .
essentially for her - she was not able to do daily chores - going to the grocery , using stairs , etc . and rest did not help .
the doctors say that there is not a cure , but other people with this find that activity regime ##ns and physical therapy help .
she was heading that direction , but the doctors said that if she went to a wheelchair that she may just get worse . she has a walker to encourage her to use her leg muscles but not fall .
she is working with someone now - we are trying to coordinate as a family to make sure she keeps her appointments . so far we see no big change but she thinks she is getting better .
it is not too expensive with insurance covering the therapy . the biggest out of pocket expense has been the chair rail seat for the stairs .
me too the problems with obesity are obvious , as it can cause many diseases and conditions like type 2 diabetes and even cancer .
what really worries is child obesity , it is becoming more common and it is becoming a serious public health concern .

i have seen the larger ones in the ocean and the smaller ones in aquarium ##s . these things are super protected by government agencies in the wild and domestic .
not quite , but they will be very soon . they have a very slow reproductive rate so it takes aw ##ile for new ones to be had .
sadly it is pollution that kills most of them . also the chinese use them in most medicines . there gills have good properties for healing .

tor ##tell ##ini are typically stuffed with a mix of meat or cheese . what are your favorite stuffing ##s ?
the word " soldier " derives from the middle english word " so ##ude ##our " , most people don ##t know that .
in most armed forces use of the word " soldier " has taken on a more general meaning . it now a days means grunt
my brother ! soldiers " are referred to by names or ranks which reflect an individual ' s military occupation so the use a lot of titles .
most of the time it is my the occupation such as para ##tro ##oper , gr ##ena ##dier , ranger , sniper , engineer , sap ##per , craftsman , just to name a few
i think it is because the action of skill of looking after children as a provider is very important . do you think so ?
yes that is very true . i have read that day care can actually refer to daytime care for disabled or elderly people in the uk . i think this is positive .
no just no age ##ism or the stereo ##ty ##ping and discrimination of individuals based on age .
like how the fda or department of he ##ak ##th of the united states regulate food . yes .
i really like u2 also . i will pretty much listen to anything by them and it seems like they just keep getting better . their 9th album , " pop " is one of the best ! ! !
they formed in 1976 . it ' s hard to believe they have been putting out great music that long .
if not they certainly deserve to be , but i ' m not sure . i ' ll have to travel up to cleveland , ohio to see for myself i guess . maybe i ' ll get lucky and they will be in concert up there at the same time !

i may not but the character first appeared in " aqua ##man "
yes you can learn more black man ##ta had no definitive origin story
you can also know that the character will make his cinematic de ##bu ##nt
because i have some great facts about 7 !
perfect ! hindus first wrote the number 7 in one stroke as a curve that looked like ' j '
the ar ##bas then added their own contribution . they wanted to make the line more diagonal than straight
definitely ! they ' re also one of two american motorcycle companies to survive the great depression . the company has been going strong for years making good bikes .
yes , they have factories all over the world . york , pennsylvania ; milwaukee , wisconsin ; kansas city , missouri ; mana ##us , bra ##zi . just to name a few places . they ' re a popular biker club motorcycle .
i don ' t know to be honest ! yamaha and kawasaki both are very popular motorcycle brands . but harley - davidson also makes merchandise , home decor , ornaments and accessories .
mug ##s , pillows , bed sheets . they sponsor clubs and events all over the world .
pasta is a no ##odle dish made from a dough consisting of eggs and flour ( typically se ##mo ##lina , which is what i use ) . great in italian cooking !
how long has it been used ? earliest references show around 115 ##4 in sicily , at least for italian pasta !
yes , i make it myself ! you mix 1 egg per 1 cup of flour for the dough , then slice for delicious fresh noodles !
it pairs great with it and it is one of the most popular cheese ##s in the world
the first mention of go ##uda cheese was is 118 ##4 !
the cheese itself is names after a dutch city .
in the middle ages the dutch could obtain rights that would give them a monopoly on certain goods like cheese
burgundy isn ' t bad , little too brownish for me but i respect it . red is usually the color of pills that are st ##im ##ula ##nts .
absolutely , red and other colors can be highly influential for people . i ' m sure you ' ve heard that thing about red cars being pulled over more often .
makes sense . i mean , after all , it ' s literally in our blood . the hem ##og ##lo ##bin in blood is what gives it its red color .
yep , it carries the oxygen in our blood cells . when it gets exposed to the air , it ox ##idi ##zes and becomes a bright red !
oh yes , billie holiday , or lady day as her friend used to call her . she was a legend for sure !
what i loved about her was that she has excellent vocal delivery and improvisation ##al skills .
ye ##a i believe she did . all i know is that i love jazz music , and it ' s been hailed as one of america ' s original art forms .
i really like making bread ##s , but i ' d have to say cakes are my favorite baked good .
it must be hard to resist the temptation of eating all your creations ! do you ever put stuff like fresh fruit or nuts in your cakes ?
wow sounds delicious . have you ever combined baking with grill ##ing to produce a hybrid barbecue variant ?
it borders the city of buffalo - niagara falls , ny , usa and niagara falls , ontario , canada .
it ' s a natural attraction , so it ' s been around before people settled there .
according to the sources provided , there are peak tourists times at niagara falls .
you are welcome . check out the niagara frontier transportation authority for travel info if you ' re interested in visiting .
i prefer homemade bread ! when production was industrial ##ized baking was automated by machines and it just doesn ' t taste the same
most people make bread with flower and water but i love to add yeast , it tastes much better
lots of post soviet union countries use yeast when they make bread . types , shape and texture of bread ##s differ around the world @
there just isn ' t enough funding in the public system . therefore , a lot of privately operation preschool ##s exist and cost a fortune .
i think preschool ##s should be 100 % funded as it benefits the public system as a whole . parents are able to enter the workforce and todd ##lers will not be disadvantaged based on the schooling they receive .
teachers should tested annually to ensure they are knowledge ##able and understand today ' s latest teaching trends .
i actually do not know that answer , but i believe it should be mandated on a go forward basis to ensure the best education for todd ##lers today .
i ' m a big fan of the ice ##man . kim ##i rai ##kko ##nen , the finn in the ferrari .
well you can ' t go wrong root ##ing for the oldest sr ##u ##vi ##ving and the most successful f ##om ##ula one team . ferrari has competed in every season since 1950 .
make sure you also look up michael sc ##hum ##aker . he holds the most world championships of a formula driver , all with ferrari . but the poor guy seems to be in dire straight ##s after a skiing accident .
i ' m not sure about the specific wavelength of red . the greek letter lambda is used as a symbol for wavelength .
wavelength repeats and has the inverse of the spatial frequency .
they are measured in the si unite which is cycles per meter .
not really , other than it is very pretty to look at .
they sold much much more that just motorcycles , and also have a large overseas market .
apparel , home decor , accessories , toys things like that
yes you can go to any harley store and buy hats ts ##hir ##ts , cups and mug ##s .
it ' s a specific pepper originated in mexico
you ' d think dr pepper was spicy since it has pepper in the name but is has a different unique flavor .
jones soda might have a spicy soda , they ' re known for their unusual flavors .
they are mostly found in warm temperate , subtropical and tropical waters .
they can be larger like the " m . bi ##ros ##tri ##s " or smaller like " m . alfred ##i " . weren ; t you scared of them ?
it seems that they are filter feeder ##s and eat large quantity of zoo ##pan ##kt ##on .
yes they are listed as vulnerable by the international union for conservation of nature .
well there used to be a recognized system that people thought was concrete surrounding wine testing . but recently scientists have been exploring the objective parameters of the human ol ##factory system .
typically the wine taste ##rs will all sip the wine , then use an ever evolving system of terminology to describe the aroma ##s , flavors , and characteristics of the wine .
i guess you could say that . anyone can do it though , there ' s just usually a less analytical process for personal appreciation .
that reminds me of how the chocolate chip cookie was first created in 1938 by ruth graves
she randomly decided to put bits of chocolate into a normal cookie !
i believe ruth kept the recipe a secret for many years after .
i am not sure . i wonder if she was the first ever baker ?
science fiction ##s movies have been entertaining audiences since the 1960 ' s .

com ##pu ##ls ##ive over eater ##s depend too much on food to comfort themselves when they are stressed or depressed .

i don ' t know . some medicines have been linked to over eating . they are called do ##pa ##mine ago ##nist ##s , one is pr ##ami ##pe ##x ##ole
high rates of cardiovascular disease . it is a big issue .
as long as you don ' t abuse it your central nervous system will be okay
yes , it reduces my anxiety and makes me more social .
to relax you can also have non alcoholic drinks
maybe because brown hair has so much variation . it can range from a light brown to nearly black . that ' s pretty broad i think .
i never realized until recently that brown hair strands are actually thicker than those of fair hair . i thought they were all the same !
people with brown hair are known as brunette . that term came from the french word br ##une ##t !
" br ##un " is actually still used in scotland , especially in rural areas . i thought that was really interesting !
well you can always have it done by a professionally hair ##dre ##sser or at home by someone else who has done it before .
something fun sounds great , you want to look your best for the guys . just use one bottle and don ##t over do it or you will ruin the color !
well if your hair is blond , then you shouldn ##t b ##lea ##ch it , just wash it really good and choose a darker color . you don ##t want to ruin your hair roots .
well in the practice of changing the hair color id just make sure to use plenty of moist ##uri ##zing sham ##poo to make sure your scalp doesn ##t dry out .
did you do it yourself , or have it professionally done ?
yeah , i don ' t think i would trust myself doing it at home . i know many people at work who dye their hair wanting to hide grey hairs .
professional hair st ##yl ##ist also cut and style hair too . they don ' t just dye hair .
it was around 6 years ago , how about you ? i probably won ' t ever dye it again , i have grown fond of my current hair color .
i have red hair , but one of my girls has brown hair because she has more eu ##mel ##ani ##n and mel ##ani ##n in her genes .
this is interesting , red hair has thicker strands than brown and blonde hair is thinner . brown is perfectly in the middle .
people with brown hair are usually called brunette ' s which is taken from the french word br ##un .
yeah ! mars is also the fourth planet from the sun !
yeah . it ' s just really cool how similar it is to earth . the period and seasonal cycles are very similar to earth ' s .
yeah . pretty cool in my opinion . anyway , mars also got it ' s name from the roman god of war .
yeah , they ' re very interesting . the planets in astro ##logy during the greek ages actually have different meanings than today ' s modern understanding of planets .
yes ! well niagara has more than six million cubic feet of water that crest ##s the fall every minute !
yes you should ! it actually includes three waterfalls . the biggest is the horseshoe falls !
it is located between terra ##pin point on goat island in ny and table rock in ontario !
i ' m still working on getting better proper nutrition ( che ##eto ##s get me ) but moderate vigorous exercise feels great
i get fatigue ##d if i don ' t . do you feel better the days you do ? defined as capacity to carry out the day ' s without it
true , very true . same here . i heard fitness is defined as a state of being fit . i think it ' s more of a way of life . it not easy to choose that daily though
have you ever tried to dye it ? i attempted to dye my hair blue before , but it didn ' t take since my hair is so dark . i would probably have to b ##lea ##ch it to make it work .
yeah , that ' s probably the best idea . i ' m a bit intimidated by trying to b ##lea ##ch it at home , though . i ' d probably just go to a hair ##dre ##sser at a salon to do it for me .
me too ! ! ! at least a hair ##dre ##sser has some degree of training . if i can ' t manage to do it myself , might as well go to somebody licensed for it
if i went to a hair ##dre ##sser , though , i ' d want to make sure i get my full money ' s worth ! forget just dye ##ing my hair - i ' ll stay there until it is colored , cut , and styled perfectly . then i ' ll just have to sleep upright to avoid messing it up !
interesting to know they are 1 of 2 motorcycle manufactures that survived the great depression
there was a company called indian , i was not familiar with that brand , i would assume they are not around anymore
harley davidson was actually originally founded in 1903
i don ##t know but a lot that ##s for sure , there are so many harley owners clubs around the world , people are ve ##r dedicated to the brand
red usually has a wavelength up to 740 nano ##meter ##s .
the planet mars is red due to iron oxide .
red was incredibly influential to the maya ##ns and the ancient egyptians .
jazz is considered to be " american ' s classical music " to some . in new orleans is where it originated .
jazz is considered to be a truly original art form . i rally enjoy charles ming ##us
the trumpet is used . swing and blue notes come up often .
the difference to fantasy is that it avoids the super ##national and often has a foundation in actual science . i love star trek as well .
no , tell me more about it . isn ' t e ##bola this dangerous virus that can cause internal and external bleeding .
interesting relationship there between science fiction in a series such as " the simpsons " and global events .
not really , you use flour and water , not to mention yeast . that is just regular white bread , i love making pumpkin bread .
oh yeah , i love to mix in cream cheese with it too . it ' s nice to watch in the oven , how it heats from the surface into the center making it rise .
i used to watch my grandma in the kitchen all the time . women usually do baking at home while men do so in restaurants .
that ' s nice ! you should give baking a try . also , baking can be combined with grill ##ing to produce a hybrid bar ##be ##que variant by using both methods simultaneously .
yes , you absolutely can , and it tastes wonderful that way ! likewise , you can always ba ##ke your meat ##s to make them more tender rather than fry them , etc .
not much , other than a pan to put it on so it doesn ' t fall through the rails . ha !
i like to ba ##ke cakes , cookies , pie ##s , bread ##s , and other past ##ries . dessert ##s can be so fun to make .
yes , after w ##w ##2 the president rep ##ur ##posed their wartime production machine to make motorcycles
yes ! yamaha is the largest manufacturer of musical instruments but they also make audio / visual , home appliances , and sporting goods
they company ' s musical origins are so influential to the company that their logo is three inter ##lock ##ing tuning forks
the first bike they made was patterned after the german d ##k ##w rt ##12 ##5
yes you must achieve fitness through repeated exercise and a good diet .
body ##weight exercises do a very good job . they don ' t use any outside weights and just use the weight of your body .
yes most of the exercises are simple abilities such as pulling pushing or squat ##ting .
there are many different kinds of diet ##s you can choose . some include low cal ##ori ##e , low fat , low car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##te .
that ' s interesting because a darker person usually have more individual hair f ##oll ##icles on their scalp so they are darker . are you siblings the same ?
is the blond yellowish color ? very different than brown / almost black hair ! the 2 types of mel ##ani ##n : eu ##mel ##ani ##n and ph ##eo ##mel ##ani ##n make up hair color .
i wonder if skin color has anything to do with it - skin pigment ##ation is also genetic from their birth parents .
light skin is most commonly found amongst native people in europe and ne asia
i had the spaghetti with tomato and meat sauce so good .
i tried penn ##e noodles it ' s best when you have cincinnati chili with the noodles .
yes you can use any no ##odle types you want instant noodles or dried your preference .
love it it ' s also great to have a side of mac ##aro ##ni and cheese as a side dish .
i ' m not sure , but i do know that enzo ferrari wasn ' t initially interested in producing road cars back when he formed sc ##uder ##ia ferrari ##a in 1929
i know that ferrari didn ' t start producing sports cars until 1947 , 18 years after the sc ##uder ##ia ferrari racing team was formed !
i ' m not sure , but they are the oldest surviving and most successful formula one team , they ' ve competed in every world championship since 1950 !
oh well there is a comic - con international convention , wonder ##con , in ana ##hein , and the alternative press expo , in san francisco .
well for example on wednesday evening before the official opening people can attend " preview night " to look at the different exhibits of comics and such .
that ' s right . people even can win the annual ink ##pot award for dressing so well as person of interest in the comic and arts world .
i like batman and wonder woman . i also like spider ##man . i like the more classic ones . i have won one of those ink ##pot awards for dressing as each .
that ' s er year ! i do it at home . i have to do it every few weeks to cover those gray ##s
and that ' s why a lot of folks do it professionally . i ' d never try highlighting or frost ##ing at home .
and not only do they smell , but they can ir ##rita ##te the skin . ammonia is very ca ##ust ##ic !
highlights , maybe . but as far as * changing * my color by dye ##ing it - - i haven ' t been tempted yet ! but it ' s nice to know there are options !
it ' s not that i don ' t feel comfortable - - i just sometimes want to do something * different * . it ' s super common , obviously , in the western world - - but variety can be fun .
i mean , as a brunette i have thicker hair than blonde ##s typically do - - but not as much as redhead ##s . speaking of . . . red could be fun ! is there a color you like ?
that ' s an unusual combo , isn ' t it ? you know what makes hair darker ? something called " eu ##mel ##ani ##n " . that ' s what makes hair darker !
well , i figured if i don ' t want gray hair i might as well be bold .
actually , i get a lot of compliment ##s . it ' s a deep purple that only really stands out in the sun . today hair coloring is very popular .
oh , you ' re probably thinking of the light purple , or violet . this is a dark plum brown that only shows purple in the sun and then a very deep shade . covers gray well .
i believe that some san die ##nga ##ns named she ##l do ##rf , richard alf , ken k ##ru ##eger and mike tow ##ry started it
not sure . i like that it lasts for four days , thursday thru sunday and is in the summer , july .
there is also a preview night for attendees before it starts so they can be first to walk the exhibit hall .
andrea is portrayed by laurie holden in that tv series . she is really good .
it ' s actually a primary color for the r ##gb and cm ##yk color model .
well , the reason that mars is red is because of the iron oxide on it . that ' s pretty cool !
me too ! actually , red pigment is one of the first colors that was used way back in prehistoric times .
yes , back in the renaissance , they used it for nobles and wealthy .
yeah , it would be a pain to put color in every day . sounds fun ! i love seeing colors like that in people ' s hair and i even love the gray styles that are so fashionable these days . me , i need to dye my gray hairs i ' m getting and i ' m too young to be getting them !
i hear ya . i love the mermaid gray and green and purple combo too . or pink ! hair coloring can be done by a professional or at home . . . which do you prefer ?
that ' s what i do too . its hard to afford hair coloring professionally . at home coloring in the us reached 1 . 9 billion in 2011 and is expected to go even higher at 2 . 2 billion dollars each year . i believe it .
not so ! but brown hair is the second most common human hair color though .
bingo ! yes , it is ! and brown hair actually varies from light brown to almost black !
do you get called a brunette with your brown hair ? that ' s a pretty common way to refer to those with brown hair like you have .
do you remember the model ? as of 2014 , honda , hero mo ##to ##corp , and yamaha were the top three producers .
not to my knowledge . bmw is pretty interesting though . by 2015 , they were the 12th largest producer in the world !
i ' m not sure which make , but , china was the biggest producer in 2009 !
no , only dough ##s that you want to rise , like bread , pizza dough , dough ##nut ##s , etc .
the good ones are fried ! i love how trend ##y dough ##t ##nut ##s have become .
maybe the new trend towards things can be eaten with your hands , like street food . . . it ' s all okay with me , i love to eat .
anything on a stick , or rolled up - cr ##ep ##es , spring rolls - that doesn ' t need a fork !
i for sure believe in prevent ##ive healthcare , or measures taken for disease prevention as opposed to just treatment .
i enjoy the study of public health practices . analyzing health of a population and threats to the society .
wow . it is a major issue here in the us , as you know , resulting in many deaths from related diseases .
the main reason it ' s done is to cover grey or to change the color for fashion or to restore the original color after the sun .
it can be done at home if you only want to go a few shades darker or lighter , but anything more you really need a hair ##dre ##sser .
b ##lea ##ching blond hair , if not done professionally , results in a lot of damage .
i like walnut ##s in my brown ##ies . do you enjoy any cooking tv shows ?
i enjoy chopped even though they don ##t do much baking .
i enjoy when they make israeli cuisine such as hum ##mus and co ##us ##cous .
hum ##mus is traditionally made up of mas ##hed chick ##pe ##as combined with olive oil , salt , and lots of garlic !
jazz truly is ' america ' s classical music ' .
jazz has roots in west african cultural where my grandmother is from so maybe that explains my love . i don ' t know .
that person could be you . jazz is deeply rooted within the black experience of the united states , different cultures have contributed their own experience , make it your own !
good for you ! your responsibilities as a conductor will include : making announcements and opening and closing doors . pretty simple , no need to be nervous .
as a conductor you will usually stay in the center of the train where you will be able to best view the platform . i hope you have good eyes !
most transit systems use one person train operation these days because of advances in automation . but few transit systems continue to employ conductors . so you ' re kinda lucky to be one of the few remaining conductors . robots are taking our jobs !
yeah ##a and in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it developed into blues and rag ##time too .
yeah it seems like it . i like how all the musical styles it ' s connected to lead to african - american and european - american . another awesome thing is it ' s evolved into performance as well !
that ' s nice too ! originally it was characterized by swing and blue notes for example , response vocals and poly ##rh ##yt ##hm ##s but of course all that evolved with time too .
yeah even though music in the us is so multi - ethnic . it was influenced by west african , irish , scottish and of course european among many others .
it will requires you to have both a detailed knowledge of the academic disciplines and a decent competence in its applied practice which is the art or " craft " of medicine .
al ##ot across the usa but i like john hopkins university for it . also , know that degrees and other qualifications vary widely , but there are some common elements , such as medical ethics
i ' m not sure but i think it ' s usually longer than others . it would interest you to know that the role of the physician and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world .
john hopkins hospital : ) do you that around the world the term physician refers to a specialist in internal medicine ?
you should do the granny hair . it is a new trend where young women are dying their hair different shades of gray .
you can do it at home or it can be done professionally .
i think it looks nice especially for the desire to look more fashionable .
i like to do more body ##weight exercises where i just use my own weight instead of machines or equipment .
body ##weight exercises can work hand in hand with those tools to build strength , flexibility , and balance .
i ' ve tried it a few times for strength training to help increase bone and muscle strength .
i ' ll do all sorts of varieties of exercises for strength training including sports like power ##lifting and shot put .

ye ##a i bet it will be fun . the most common animals in sport are horses and dogs .
it really would . the largest falls , the horseshoe falls are right on the border between the us and canada .
not sure if its the most famous , but the horseshoe falls is the most powerful one in the us and canada .
yes , it does . the american falls and the br ##idal veil falls are entirely on the american side .
they ' re north - northwest of buffalo , between there and toronto , canada .

absolutely . the most common cause of obesity is a combination of excessive food intake and a lack of exercise .
the best way to prevent or combat it is through a combination of social changes and personal choices like eating less and exercising more .

more jokes about arabic nu ##meral ##s such as the number 7 ? no , i ' m afraid that ' s all i have at the moment .

i do ! i learned a lot about binary code as it per ##tain ##s to giving computer processor instructions in a university class called " numerical methods . "
well i don ' t ko ##n ##w for sure , but i imagine that 8 bit binary strings ( 256 steps ) for things like letters didn ' t crop up until the advent of the trans ##isto ##r in the 20th century .
well its a bio ##l ##go ##ical , generic , infections and psychological mechanisms have been proposed , but the cause is not understood
ye ##a the fatigue is not due to st ##ren ##ous ongoing ex ##ert ##ion , is not much relieved by rest , and is not due to previous medical condition
ye ##a and there is no cure with treatment being sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic
i ' ve heard a mixture of opinions , but what does it say ? i definitely know it ' s a primary color in the r ##gb model lo ##l .
well , it probably does ! since the ancient egyptians and maya ##ns used it in ceremonies and roman generals used it to praise a victory , those were strong people !
it ' s been found by historians , and back in the renaissance period , the nobles and wealthy would use it to dye their costumes . it a strong and beautiful color !
i also like blue , which is the color of the sky and deep sea due to scattering of light .
it is called ray ##leigh scattering , caused by elastic scattering of light from particles much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation .
going back to the color red , it is the color of mars because of iron oxide , also known for rust .
well some of them include scarlet , crimson , and ve ##rmi ##lli ##on !
i also like purple , which is a color intermediate between blue and red . it reminds me of the sunset .
indigo is a deep and rich color close to the color wheel blue and it lies somewhere at the beginning of the spectrum .
there are numerous variations of the color along the spectrum . potentially thousands !
black is the absence of color , so no approximation of the color will be found
the visible spectrum includes wavelengths from 390 and 700 nm . the primary colors are red , green , blue .
wavelengths are what human eyes can per ##ce ##pt . values outside the wavelength are detect ##able by computers !
indeed ! for example infrared radiation is invisible to humans but detect ##able by science instruments !
no , microwave ##s are lower on the spectrum with wavelengths between 1 meter to 1 mm
yes it can . but it provides parents the opportunity to work and make more money for the family , and allows children to begin their education sooner .

i am a hair ##dre ##sser that does hair coloring .
i studied comet ##ology in school . it is beauty treatment .
yes because there are lot more beauty salon ##s such as spa ##s .
i don ' t like bright colors , but they are popular at hair salon ##s .
yeah thriller was quite good , the 80s also saw the emergence of new wave as a genre .
new wave was similar to punk rock but also included electronic elements , tears for fears is an example .
tears for fears formed in 1981 , some of their popular songs are everybody wants to rule the world and head over heels . you should really check them out .
you really should , i ' m sure you ' ve heard everybody wants to rule the world , it was released in 1985 and is still really popular today , it was covered by lord ##e a few years back .
they were first given the name in 1868 by an australian museum director , they are relatively doc ##ile too .
i would believe it , their pe ##ctor ##al fins are super delicate too , you can ' t catch and release them . humans are demons .
yep , the aquatic loco ##mot ##ion that is the stoke of the human race has been a sloppy dog paddle as far as ta ##ct ##fulness goes .
k ##ry ##pton ##ite man is the name of several super ##vill ##ains who appear in stories published by dc comics , so you agree super man is one , don ' t you ?

yeah ! superman debuted in " action comics " # 1 ( cover - dated june 1938 ) and subsequently appeared in various radio serials , newspaper strips .
i think that it was in the 1950 ' s , after world war ii .
yes there has . likely due to the correlation of fitness with attractive ##ness .
i think that it ' s so desirable now because people attribute positive personality traits with attractive people .
yes , it would . i wonder if back then it was just an ability to work hard and fulfill your daily activities ?
yes , colors can be measured and quan ##ti ##fied in various ways
no , but i know due to biology different people see the same illuminated object or light source in different ways .
cool , with blue , it lies between violet and green
yes , painting is a good mode of creative expression ,
my body mass index is way to high .
yes , i have tried the diet that restrict ##s my car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##tes .
i am so glad ben si ##lb ##erman ##n founded pin ##ter ##est .
mostly the fatigue that is not warrant ##ed or due to st ##ren ##uous ongoing ex ##ert ##ion
not sure but there is no real cure there is limited treatment
in the us no medications or procedures only a little cognitive therapy
mental therapy while trying to increase ability to exercise
yamaha is cool too , i just looked them up and they ' ve been in business since 1955 . they make all kinds of other stuff too , sail ##boats , water craft , snow ##mobile ##s , all kinds of stuff . i ' ve been riding for about 5 years . what about you ?

i ' m with you on that , there ' s a big problem when an economic policy that ' s supposed to help the usa results in jobs moving overseas . hopefully they ' ll come to their senses ! or we just have to wait a few years , ha ##ha
well , as long as the negotiating parties trust each other to implement solutions , they may be successful . the art of the deal right ? we ' ll see !
well the character himself was created back in 1933 would you believe by a writer jerry siegel and an artist joe shu ##ster .
he debuted in action comics in 1938 and afterwards appeared in radio serials , newspaper and then later again on tv
his arch ##ene ##my , the character who is the hero ##s main protagonist is of course the infamous lex lu ##thor .
well his superhuman abilities include flying of course . he displays this once he reaches maturity . however his big weakness is k ##ry ##pton ##ite .
i canoe too ! have you heard of canoe camping ? it ' s a multiple day canoe trip , where you camp at the end of the day .
nice ! it ' s mostly practiced in north america .
canoe ##s are also used for racing , general recreation , and water ##water canoe ##ing .
it ' s fun ! some classes of white ##water , such at 1 or 2 , are very easy for begin ##ners .
the most common baked item is bread across the world
you can make it w ##with like flour eggs and water kn ##ead ##ed into dough
because of historical social and fa ##mi ##lia ##l roles , baking has traditionally been performed at home by women for hundreds of years
i guess it ' s a silly thought , but sometimes i have them : p fun fact , your husband has more hair f ##oll ##icles because of their black hair ?
yeah , it would be that . it ' s probably one of his defining characteristics : p
grey hair can look really nice . i wonder if the fact that brown is the second most common hair color makes it more likely to see it go grey .
i know you can go from light to dark blonde , which way did you dye it ?
do you have light skin or is your family from europe ?
both of my parents have relatives in europe so with those genes i am very fair skinned .
darker hair naturally but i change it all the time like right now its purple . .

yes , an auto mechanics course !
well it can differ , he is thinking of opening automotive repair shops that will special ##ize in body ##work repair .
yes i agree . i achieve it through proper nutrition and exercise as well as good rest is important .
i know a little . before the industrial revolution people thought of fitness as your ability to do your daily activities without getting tired .
swimming is a great exercise . you can say fitness is just a quality or state of being . however you achieve it is up to your interests .
i do enjoy jazz festival and jazz is seen as americas classical music
yes that ##s correct the newport jazz festival is also held every summer in newport rhode island .
it gets cold in the winter but its very pretty in the fall you would be ok in the summer the festival as become a two site festival its in new your and in 1981 returned to newport
there was a canadian subsidiary but it went bust .
i am not sure but they did have a massive security breach sometime ago
target positioned itself above wal ##mart as cheap - chi ##c but i don ' t know about snacks
yeah in italy , the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary with the local ##e .
florence is a beautiful city , i went the ##r two summers ago . for example though back to the point , ca ##vate ##lli is known by 26 different names depending on the region .
ca ##vate ##lli is the type of pasta , i ' m sorry for misunderstanding . they are small pasta shells .
oh cool ! i want to get better at programming and software engineering since i ' m not great yet .
are you more of an engineer in your career than a computer programmer ?
oh okay , that ' s interesting . computer programming is very reward ##ing .
it ' s a great experience . the caroline on broadway is one the most establish and popular comedy clubs in the us . you should try and get there some time !
well , i think mostly because many of the top headline ##r in the u . s . have performed there like louis c . k . , jay len ##o , bill kick etc . you like any of them ?
ha ##ha yes me to . his self de ##pre ##cia ##ting and shock humor is amazing . i think he was on s ##nl a few time too .
saturday night live . it ' s a late night american comedy variety show . they do funny ski ##ts .
if you are allergic or prefer g ##lu ##ten free , then you can make pasta with rice flour .
pasta originated from sicily in 115 ##4 ?
yeah , i would love to visit italy one day and try all kinds of pasta . sicily is also the largest island of the mediterranean sea
mostly it ' s long - term fatigue that rest does not help . no one knows the cause .
there are no medications or procedures approved in the united states unfortunately .
cognitive behavioral therapy helps me a little .
i can drive . there is some new medication ri ##nta ##to ##lim ##od . i ' d like to try .
its the higher level of a dark pigment eu ##mel ##ani ##n and lower levels of the pale pigment ph ##eo ##mel ##ani ##n
i have brown as i have stated earlier . brown varies from light brown to an almost black colour . actually black hair is the most common colour in the world .
me too , we are who we are . we brown haired people will most often be referred to as brunette
that is interesting . our hair is more common around the western world especially around central europe .
the ancient greeks are the earlier known " modern type " shower users . before that it was pouring bucket ##s on your head lo ##l .
besides the shower head that spray ##s water . the real mvp of showers are the aqueduct ##s and sewage systems leading back to the greeks that i mentioned above . the pipes ( lead in the greek days ) that pump water in and out to the shower are really what make the shower possible
yes , and i am thankful ha ##ha . the showers of those days were similar to locker shower rooms that we use today . they even had a bar to hang their clothing on !
yes color psychology is very interesting . st ##im ##ula ##nt pills are usually colored red or orange for example
yes . and straight men find women in red more attractive , while it has no effect on women when men wear red
yes and finding someone attractive can be distinct from wanting them sexually
sure sixteen candles and national lamp ##oons vacation
then he did the breakfast club and weird science - my husband really likes that one .
he definitely allowed himself to become ty ##pc ##ast as his geek persona during that time .
i think i prefer blue but red is one of my favorite colors , even light red .
agreed , it is also a primary color .
oh definitely , with it ' s 625 to 740 wavelength . that ' s approximately the dominant wavelength .
me too ! i love bread ##s made with yeast . it ' s relatively recent to make bread with yeast
i ' m not sure but greeks baked over seventy - two varieties of bread ! can you believe that ?
yes . and romans used honey and oil . i bet their bread tasted so good
mmm , i ' m getting hungry : ) in europe baking oven ##s were often separated from other buildings to prevent fire . so smart of them
i change it up quite often , but purple seems mysterious so i like it the most .
it would cost a lot if i had it done professionally , but i do it myself so it isn ' t too bad . as a guy , how much does it cost you ?
i spend around $ 40 every time i do it ( probably once every other month ) . it ' s no wonder the home coloring has reached almost 2 billion dollars in the us .
well clown ##s have been around since we hand kings and monarchy , powerful people like being entertained . but there is such a wide variety of costumes and performance .
modern clown ##s a strongly associated with the circus clown mainly .
well before clown ##s were for the entertainment of the select few , now a days they are generally designed to entertain large audiences from a distance .
ha ##ha yep so many pasta dishes you can make easily and its so simple with just some noodles and protein / sauce
oh really ? its a staple italian food but not usually by itself , what about sauce ?
oh ok that sounds pretty good though when it comes to traditional pasta cuisine i prefer it with a meat sauce
ye ##a , i also prefer normally noodles and not rice flour or g ##lu ##ten free stuff
my twins are 2 years old . it is interesting to be able to see how genetics play more of a role than environmental factors
being identical , they share 100 % of their genes and their personalities are so similar no matter who and what they are individually exposed to .
yes they do that even at 2 years old ! twins are the perfect way to study nature vs . nur ##ture .
in my personal experience , they seem to keep cleaner stores , but have less variety overall and slightly higher prices .
it would be nice for there to be some kind of cross between target and wal ##mart . lower prices , and cleaner store with variety - and a company that cared about its employees . but i doubt that will happen .
that ' s the problem . wal ##mart claims it causes lower prices through efficiency , but the charges of discrimination and foreign product sour ##cing bel ##ie that . though i doubt target is true ##ly innocent in all those things either .
most armed forces consider " soldier " with a general meaning .
typically , the uniforms denote the rank by an insignia attached to the uniforms .
soldier ranks include trooper , marine , sniper , ranger , and med ##ic .
during the 20th century , asian americans attended us military academies .
no , doctors still do not know the cause . it could be biology , genetics or in someone ' s head from what i understand anyway ##s .
i had some back pain once and it shot into my arms and hands , i actually went to a chi ##rop ##rac ##tor and she bent me back into shape and the pain was gone .
well some back problems are caused by muscle strain , so maybe by lifting you strengthened the muscles that were affected .
yeah diagnosis is based on the presented symptoms .
yeah and it doesn ' t go away in fact no medications have been approved in the united states .
yes and no , if you had it i ' m sure you would want medication for it , there is tentative evidence that supports the use of ri ##nta ##to ##lim ##od .
yeah exactly , that tentative evidence has been deemed insufficient for fda approval .
it was founded by enzo ferrari in 1939 . it began from alfa romeo ' s race division
well , it was rated by brand finance in 2014 as the world ' s most powerful brand
they are ! though now they are owned 90 % by fiat
indeed , ferrari has continued to thrive and is one of the most successful sports car companies
i love using almond flour . there ##s four grains that dominated in nordic countries . do you know what they are ?
wheat barley rye o ##ats
not at all . i love to stick with sp ##routed bread instead .
have you tried sp ##out ##ed bread ? its become super popular .
i need to avoid g ##lu ##ten so i choose pasta ##s made from rice flour .
no , i believe they are similar in that regard . i just have to avoid the g ##lu ##ten found in grains like wheat .
sounds good , there are hybrid zu ##cchi ##nis with yellow and orange coloring . would be neat to have a colorful pasta dish !
well i have gotten a lot of ideas from the great british ba ##ke off , which is a cooking show where baker ##s compete against each other
the contestants go through three challenges for baking and each episode some are eliminated
they ba ##ke everything . it started airing in 2010 and has become very popular
i am not sure . i know the second season they were located in the valentine ##s mansion
yes i do currently . another fact is that salon ##s have been around since the early 1940s
not much information on that but i did find that women play a huge role within the salon ##s
yeah i agree ! another fact is that hair styling can be done on facial or body hair
yeah ! another fact about body hair is that the growth of and ##rogen ##ic hair is related to the level of and ##rogen ##s
even in cultures there are a lot of sub ##culture ##s , most hindus speak hindi but bengali hindus speak bengali
in the case with europe , the number has evolved to look like the number g ##yl ##ph of one
yes and the number 7 is usually associated with luck , especially in gambling and irish folklore
they are usually called " one armed bandits " because they had one lever and led to many people losing money
i take it easy in though to not be overwhelmed , i say to my ##el ##f . . . it ' s going to be a good day , fitness is defined as the quality of being fit . . . and then do my 4 am routine : )
i like to get all ready to start the day and want to have morning routine done by 6 . when did you realize you were starting to become fit ? mine was when i could carry daily activities without fatigue . i looked in the mirror and bam the body match the emotions
i just ask because i care , are you taking care of yourself with good eating habits too ? you need proper nutrition if you do moderate - vigorous activities .
now i feel concerned for you ! they contain high levels of cal ##ories from " sugar " or fat . i like your positive attitude though
whoa ! interesting ! i ' ve heard that it has a wavelength of approximately 625 - 740 nano ##meter ##s .
i ' ve heard it has something to do with some sort of ray ##leigh scattering . i wonder what causes the red color of the grand canyon .
back in the renaissance days , the red costumes were dyed with ke ##rm ##es and cochin ##eal .
i ' ve heard about that . ancient egyptians and maya ##ns colored their faces red in ceremonies .
pasta is great and has been around since 115 ##4
ye ##a and it pasta was founded in italy , sicily
pasta has two broad categories , dry and fresh
fresh is great .
that ##s funny that you mention that as these include sports that are located underwater , over water , or in water
well there are one person recreational activities , such as scuba - diving and sw ##i , , ing , as well as com ##pet ##iv ##ite sports , such as boat racing and underwater football
ye ##a well some of the sports include only one part related to swim ##ing , such as a tri ##athlon
if you are curious perhaps you should start with a natural dye . it ' s plant based so less harsh .
the natural color from things like berries , bark give off a color to the hair when applied .
no not a remedy . it ' s just a pigment ##ation color given to the hair . mainly for style preference .
that is a hard question . there are over 310 types of pasta !
it is ok but a pain to eat the long noodles . i like smaller easier to eat pieces . its interesting how all the different types of pasta have different cooking styles
yes . and italy has a lot of regional diversity in their food with all sorts of sauce ##s
i lived there for a while . it is a great country with a temperate climate
yes some people call that emotional eating . it helps people cope with negative emotions .
there are health ##ier ways to regulate emotions , such as exercising and reading a good book .
it sounds like you are in touch with your well - being . this is a big part of the positive psychology practice .
the t ##lc series cake boss is set in a bakery that was founded in 1910 . went there once they have amazing cup ##cake ##s .
that ' s interesting , and mexican bread ##s were actually influenced by the french
and much health ##ier without all the fat ##s ,
id like to think so . for begin ##ners the most common item to ba ##ke is bread . then you can branch out and ba ##ke other various food items . i would start with that .
that must be a good memory . i wouldn ##t call myself a baker though since i am no professional . i do enjoy doing it in my spare time . it also makes my friends happy .
some people don ##t realize it but baking truly is an art form . it takes skill . different cultures have their own types of bread ##s and it is important for nutrition .
7 follows a natural progression . in the bible , i believe it stands for completion
i am sure there are . there were 13 elders in the church in revelation ! seven is also considered a lucky number
yes i do . in revelation 13 is the number of elders in revelation
human society has placed great value on beauty of human body
it ' s actually so interesting that some time ago " fitness " was defined as the cap ##asi ##ty to carry out the day ' s activities
now fitness is considered a measure of the body ' s ability to function efficiently to be healthy and resist diseases
fitness can even describe machine ' s ability to perform a specific function . that ' s strange , right ?
i ' m not that familiar with jazz but i know it is viewed by many people as ' america ' s classic music ' and has a large following . who is your favorite artist ?
he was famous for his compositions in rag ##time and was called the " king of rag ##time " which indicates his success !
i would love to learn more about jazz which is such a major form of musical expression . i enjoy all types of music actually . i am quite eclectic is music taste .
i don ' t know a great deal about drake but was surprised to see he gained his start as an actor on a teen drama series in the 2000s . lo ##l
i play for ##za motorsport on my xbox
there are 2 games . the original for ##za , and for ##za horizon which is an open world game made by playground sports .
as of 2010 , they had sold over 10 million copies of for ##za in just 5 years , so 2005 .

what is your favorite instrument in rock songs ?
yes i love concerts . my first one was led zeppelin in 1973 , i saw them play stairway to heaven live ! it ' s considered one of the best rock songs ever .

where do you live ? the other notable rock bands i have seen myself are ac / dc and black sabbath . i wish i could have seen styx .
how dark did it get ? mine is pretty dark but it can vary from dark to light brown .

yeah that hair . euro disco and dance pop were so popular at this time .
speaking of hair . . . g ##lam metal took the cake . rocking on w ##ham ##my bars and wearing eye ##liner were the thing .
you would be in good company with kiss and alice cooper too .

medical personnel point out that the long term effects of drinking alcohol include damage to the liver and brain , so i ' d say you ' re better off without it !
absolutely not . sob ##riety means you don ' t have any me ##asurable effects from alcohol , so being sober means you ' re health ##ier .
i really don ' t know the answer to that . it ' s worth remembering though that a 2014 report by the who estimated that there were about 3 . 3 million deaths due to alcohol consumption worldwide .

superman debuted in " action comics " # 1 ( cover - dated june 1938 ) and the rest is history
i ' ve never been there but i have heard of br ##idal veil falls - just didn ' t realize it was part of the niagara
i cannot believe that more than six million cubic feet of water goes over the falls every minute - that is crazy a lot of water !
that ' s a lot better than nuclear power - even though it is an alternative to fossil - fuel power systems .
i would agree and the us is already the fourth largest producer of hydroelectric ##ity in the world . so we are well on our way .
i wouldn ##t assume the worst , but currently there is no known cure , but there is promising treatment for it .

you can also try styx . they sing other type of music too but i like them because they are american rock band from chicago . i love their albums released in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
just like everybody i like them for hit songs " lady " , " come sail away " , " babe " , " the best of times " , " too much time on my hands " and " mr . robot ##o " .

my favorite might be marcel ##ine , the 1000 year old vampire queen !
marcel ##ine is a character from adventure time . it ' s an animated series by pendleton ward .

you probably just don ' t watch cartoon network enough ! if you have basic cable or satellite , you ##d find cartoon network which is a subsidiary of tbs
typically children are taken care of by parents or siblings , but day ##care is very popular in the u . s .
oh yeah , day care is basically the term that describes that . it ' s a service usually during specific hours for while the parents are at work .

since you are a baker you must work at a bakery ! what a coincidence !
i don ' t really but since grains have been a staple food of humanity for millennia it is a very old activity , i should really learn .
yeah i ' m not really intimidated , i ' ve just never gotten around to it . some large households in rome normally had their own baker ##s . what is your favorite thing to ba ##ke ?
cheese ##cake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers , how many layers does your cheese ##cake have ?
no it actually wasn ' t we went in june it was more so windy and very wet the waterfall was very powerful the rain ##coat ##s didn ' t really help .

we couldn ##t have any cool r ##gb things in our computers without it . its one of the primary colors .
it means that with the use of combination of those 3 colors you can make almost any color . red sits at the end of the spectrum , close to orange , but opposite of violet .
green and blue make up the other two colors of the r ##gb color model .
r ##gb dates back to before the electronic age . it started out with old tv ##s !
my favorite artist are paul rev ##ere & the raiders .
they are an american rock band that saw considerable u . s . they featured prominently in the 60 ' s & 70 ' d
they won the category of the emmy , grammy , oscar and tony awards .
they made the a rock n roll genre a popular music that originated and evolved in the united states
what was the name of his talk show ? my favorite album of his is dogg ##yst ##yle , which was produced by dr . dr ##e , another one of my favorite rappers .
oh i ' ve heard of it . it was produced by jack barry , right ?
yeah . it ' s really sad that it would ' ve debuted on tu ##pac ' s 46th birthday !
tu ##pac sha ##kur sold over 75 million records worldwide . you don ' t know who he is ?
it does - you are smart ! the wavelength is 625 - 740 nano ##met ##res !
yep - approximately 380 - 450 nano ##meter ##s . red has so many variations also , from yellow tinged to blu ##ish - red to red pink and even bu ##rg ##unda ##y .
i think red hair is the pre ##tti ##est hair shade ever honestly . and red is even used in ceremonies for ancient egyptians and maya ##ns
yes , even roman generals even colored their bodies in red to celebrate victories !
it ' s just historical fact ! but there ' s evidence that early ( rich ) egyptians had indoor shower rooms .
it ' s possible , because they did have ru ##diment ##ary drainage systems in the rooms .
their sewage systems were made of lead pipes , actually .
i believe they used och ##re . however , anything that contains the protein hem ##og ##lo ##bin appears red . the same is true for anything with ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##ns .
well , it is the hem ##og ##lo ##bin in blood for instance that makes it appear red . ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##ns are found in berries and autumn leaves .
it ' s true ! cultures like the ancient egyptians and maya ##ns colored there face red in ceremonies . i ' ve even read that our vision has evolved to pay particular attention to red .
i have heard that as well . it ' s theo ##rized that red is a strong visual cue because it is the color of blood . think about a mata ##dor ' s cape .
yes , and items are a bit different . it used to be named good ##fell ##ow dry goods back in 1902 when it was first opened , and went through a few more names until 1910
well , the actual first target opened in minnesota in 1962 , but the parent company was renamed dayton corporation in 1967 . it ' s been a process !
i ' m not sure , but they had some major public issues back in 2010 when there was a huge security breach for the customer ' s credit card data in canada . but , the us target ' s did better .
i have red hair so it was easy to die it blond . i think the hue works well with the color red .
it was straight up blonde . i used a really powerful dye and it created a strong blonde . what color is your hair ?
i did it at home . the results always worked great and i think salon ##s are way over ##pr ##ice ##d . i did my own hair coloring .
yes it isn ' t calming , but there is many shades of red . from yellow - tinged scarlet and ve ##rmi ##lli ##on to bu ##ils ##h - red s = crimson , it can vary from red pink to dark burgundy too . grey seems alike a much more calming choice .
this can be true , res id pretty intense , i used to have a one wall in the bedroom painted a salmon color , it ' s kind of pink ##ish tone .
yes , red and pink are considered basic color terms , it ' s easy to get fed up with basic colors .
after a shower i feel clean and fresh . i usually take one before i go to sleep .
i usually take a hot shower in the morning in order to bath ##e myself and warm up . what about you , do you usually take your showers at morning or night ?
ancient people used to use cold water out of jug ##s in order to shower .
i know that cold water would help with pain relief .
yes i have always been into physical fitness to a certain extent . i have always at least tried to work out 3 or more days a week to maintain health and body ##weight . how about you ?
i hear ya , i have slowed down some myself . i am guessing the benefits of walking daily might be to lower blood pressure , relieve stress , maintain weight ? am i anywhere close to being accurate ?
i do not know a whole lot on weight lifting for older women . i do know you should start with lightweight ##s first , and not over ##do it . physical fitness is usually achieved by eating right , moderate exercise and a good nights rest .
when you strength train the right way , it can improve your health , bone muscle , and ligament strength .
it is hard to explain it because it cannot be define and was never really a genre of music
one of my favorite jazz musicians is adelaide hall .
yes , i actually went to a jazz concert last summer in the prestigious preservation hall
i don ' t listen to music all that much . i ' ve been more into audio books lately .
lately i ' ve been on a william gibson kick . he was one of the early cyber ##pu ##nk authors in the early 80s .
it was a type of science fiction that focused on the future where the high technology intersect ##ed with usually a urban setting , usually the seed ##ier side of cities . think blade runner .
none of the books that i have read or listened to , but i wouldn ' t be surprised if at least one story had to deal with time travel .
there are , it varies from light brown to almost black . mine is closer to almost black so it makes it hard for me to change my color up without b ##lea ##ching it .
go ahead and dye it ! 75 % of women and 15 % of men report having dyed hair .
they ' re often referred to as " brunette " which in french is the feminine from of " br ##une ##t " , the dim ##in ##utive of " br ##un " ( brown )
oh lots ! it ' s a common hair ##color of people from europe and the us and also some populations in the greater middle east .
i have listened to it , but the whole appeal of music geared towards both aesthetic and religion doesn ' t really appeal to me .
i might have to try that and see if it changes my mind . one thing that is interesting is that it is as old as the early 17th century !
i can see that . churches rely often on clapping and st ##omp ##ing for the rhythm in gospel music .
i haven ' t , i ' ve only been to church a few times . i do that most of the singing is a cappella though
he was actually created by two high school students , jerry siegel and joe shu ##ster . that ' s a surprise , huh ?
yes , when they sold it to dc comics in 1938 , it was actually detective comics . do you like dc comics ?
yes , the original creators tried to recover their rights back to superman when he became so popular . i guess it didn ' t work huh ?
i was watching the 1978 superman movie created by warner bros with christ ##oper reeves , can you remember him as superman ?
it means i put the dough , normally in the an oven , and wait for it to dry .
yes me too , but experience makes perfect ! i mainly baked bread but many other types of foods are baked in my house .
well sometimes i combine baking with grill ##ing to produce a hybrid of chicken !
yes , chicken with rice is great ! filipino cuisine is composed of a variety of chicken !
angel hair is always a great one to use in standard italian cuisine .
one of my favorite pasta dishes is just standard meat sauce and angel hair pasta .
i love garlic in my standard italian pasta dishes .
onions are probably my favorite to add . even in classic pasta dishes . its quite common in italian cuisine .
it originated in new orleans in the 19th century , but it ' s been a staple since . i listen to it in the car while going to work
jazz is mainly associated with classical music , but it can also mix into other genres a bit .
jazz is recognized as a major form of musical expression , and you could say it ' s rag ##time , swing , or another
it ' s characterized by swing and blue notes , but it ' s the way it changes rhythm that i like
it ' s a 4 day even in july in san diego , so i ' d think it ' s one of the larger comic - con ##s .
i would probably go as a trek ##kie if i ever went since they are derivatives of science - fiction conventions .
i speak vulcan . i live by logic and reason , minus emotion .
i don ' t think sp ##ock , the character in star trek , speaks spanish without his translator !
yes , they do ! they are different sized waterfalls , named horseshoe , american and br ##idal veil falls .
yes , and horseshoe falls in actually the most powerful waterfall in all of the us !
it ' s really quite interesting and beautiful . there ' s over six million cubic feet of water that crosses the fall ' s crest every 60 seconds . can you imagine ?
yes , i think 2 of them are on the us side , and the br ##idal veil falls is separated from the others . luna island separates them .
i have to say miles davis . it ' s just jazz is magical because it ' s considered " america ' s classical music " . miles is a perfect example of that .
1920s was a jazz age so i really like it . 20s and 30 ##s jazz .
me too , it ' s amazing because jazz age ended with the great depression , jazz music and dance styles became popular and people got happy . music changes a lot .
it is i have been to all three waterfalls which are the horseshoe falls , the american falls and the br ##idal veil falls . you should visit them all .
the horseshoe falls which is my most favorite is just on the border of the united states and canada , the falls are separated by goat island
actually goat island has no residents at all , but is a popular place for tourists when visiting the falls on the u . s . side .
i am not really sure but i think they do since that there is a ferry that brings people around to the different falls in that area .
you ' re right ! i love mo ##zza ##rella cheese - especially in pizza !
go ##uda ? no . i know it means " cheese from go ##uda , the netherlands " . how is it made ?
that ' s cool . go ##uda is one of the oldest cheese ##s known . interesting , eh ?
i didn ' t know that ! you learn something new everyday .
many of their stores do . they were originally called good ##fell ##ow dry goods back in 1902 , and carried all sorts of things - including food .
i find that , even though they offer cheap products like wal ##mart , their stuff is a little more chi ##c . cheap - chi ##c !
i think it ' s a little better than at other retailers . i know wal ##mart has gotten a lot of fl ##ak for racial and gender discrimination , but i don ' t hear anything like that about target .
well to help with obesity , you can make changes to your diet . you can exercise more .
obesity is when there is excess body fat that is results in a negative effect on ones health .
its somewhat common . the most common cas ##ues of obesity is a combination of lack of physical activity , excessive food intake , and genetics .
you should try exercise and diet ##ing first . obesity is somewhat prevent ##able through a combination of personal choice and social change .
pasta is divided into two categories dried and fresh . its made in rice flour and wheat
yes it is good . it is traditional produced b hand
yes buddy . in italy the names of specific pasta shapes or t ##pes often vary with local ##e
yep its cool when baker ##s own their own bakery
baking is quite old too , as you can imagine with grain being staple food for millennia
ye ##a its great food and seems quite fun to make
many hair coloring ##s are done professionally .
i agree , but sometimes it can be done independently within the home .
hair dye ##ing is a modern art form almost , it seems
cosmetic choices are at the basis of hair coloring
interesting ##ly enough many see jazz as " american classical music " since it originated here . since the 20 ' s it ' s been recognized as such .
i love how jazz is characterized by those swing and blue notes and all of the improvisation . it truly stands apart from other genres .
yep and the roots from west african musical expression are also evident . some may also be surprised that european military band music was also an influence .
the intellectuals around the world hail jazz as on of america ' s original art forms as well . such an iconic genre . it ' s hard to think what music would be like without it .
i like angel hair too ! i learned in school that their are two kinds of pasta dried ( " pasta sec ##ca " ) and fresh ( " pasta fr ##es ##ca " ) .
one is dried the other is fresh . most dried pasta is commercially produced via an ex ##tr ##usion process today /
it means that a machine is used to make it . i per ##fer fresh pasta since fresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand
or you can make it at home . today though both dried and fresh pasta come in a number of shapes and varieties and can ##t be found almost anywhere
do you mean elvis aaron presley , the american singer and actor ?
i had just heard of him being " the king " . there probably would not have been a sun records if not for elvis and sam phillips .
i would love to hear one of his 2 sun record recordings that did not survive . there could have been a hit we never heard ! !
have you ever heard of " the million dollar quartet ' ? that was elvis , jerry lee lewis , carl perkins , and johnny cash jam ##ming on 12 / 4 / 1956 at sun records .
i live in buffalo , so it is very close by , and i have hike ##d the niagara gorge , and seen all the falls .
there are three falls , and the horseshoe falls is the biggest . for the best views you should visit both sides of the river .
yes , it is on the canadian side , but you get a great view of the region .
my fear is definitely from it . even though clown ##s are designed to entertain large audience
not sure but they go back to at least the 1800s when joseph grim ##aldi became the first mainstream clown
well he was a part of the british pan ##tom ##ime ##s and expanded the row ##l of the clown in that .
pier ##rot was a very popular pan ##tom ##ime as well . he performed un ##mas ##ked with a large white blouse and wide white pan ##tal ##oons
well red red the dish is made of fish and black ##eye ##d peas and onions and oil and tomatoes .
well in the renaissance the wealthy folk used ke ##rm ##es and cochin ##eal to make br ##ili ##nant red costumes
i actually know that ! that would be a dominant wavelength of 625 to 740 nano ##met ##res !
zac e ##fr ##on , brown hair is the second most common human hair color , after black hair
no , my hair has always been brown . its strands are thicker than those of fair hair but not as much as those of red hair
not really , also people with brown hair are often ref ##fer ##ed as brunette ' s
i will consider changing the color of my hair from brown to blond , and see what happens
dc comics is a very well known american comic book publisher , they own several of the most popular comic book characters .
yes they own batman , superman , wonder woman , and the green lantern just to name a few .
i like justice league characters , so wonder woman and the ones i just listed too .
it ' s simply a group of fictional superhero ##es that all appear in comics published by dc comics .
and because of that , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression .
that would be sarah lois vaughan . she had one of the most won ##dro ##us voices of the 20th century . "
i respect the fact that he was the first black man to host an american tv show .
there ' s a lot to learn about it ! its roots are in blues and rag ##time music , and it was originated in the late 19th to early 20th centuries .
rag ##time music is basically music with sync ##opa ##ted rhythm , or " ragged " , like the name says .
yeah , so jazz has some traits of rag ##time music , but jazz is characterized by its swing , response vocals , and improvisation !
yes ! they actually have a few types of therapy that can help like group therapy , cognitive behaviour ##al therapy , and individual therapy .

i don ' t think there ##s much known about it . it could be either biological , genetic , infectious , and psychological as possible reasons .
i ' m not sure , what have you learnt about it thus far ?
i think it me affects around 17 ##mill ##ion people world wide .
i like to ba ##ke bread , as it is the most common baked item . also cake and cookies .
the way that it works is that the oven transfers heat from the surface to the center of the baked good .
yu ##p , this is why checking the center of the baked good is so important to make sure it is fully baked . since the heat goes from the surface to the center .
yeah i like the improvisation ##al nature it has . many jazz musicians are seriously talented .
cool , did you see any artifacts from the nat ##che ##z people ? they were indigenous people that had complex chief ##dom systems .
yeah that would be interesting . however if you ' re in the area again one cool thing to see would be the grand village of the nat ##che ##z , a prehistoric village .
the village goes all the way back to the 1200 ##s ! how ' s that for history
i wish i could see it ! hair dying has a long history . in ancient greece the celtic people dyed their hair blonde .
they b ##lea ##ched it by washing it in lime and comb ##ing it back ! crazy to think of that happening so long ago .
i wish i was more adventurous with my hair , but all i ' ve done so far is use dye to cover gray ##s . that ' s the reason many people use hair dye .
i do , my main motivation was to reduce my risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes .
i lost 160 pounds ! its mainly down to the amount of physical activity i did .
thanks . you must have maintained a healthy weight through the combination of social changes and personal choices .
you can try changes to diet and exercising to increase muscular gain .
yes and there are many water sports . some are underwater , over water , or in the water .
i love underwater sports . scuba - diving is my favorite . there is something so magical about being able to descend below the water ' s surface to interact with the environment .
scuba divers carry their own source of air , allowing for great independence .
s ##nor ##kel ##ing is fun too .
nothing really . the hindus used to write their 7 ' s like an upper ##case j , vertically inverted .
interesting ##ly , the arabs developed the character from a 6 look ##ali ##ke into an upper ##case v look ##ali ##ke .
well , modern arab forms influenced the european form , a 2 stroke character consisting of a horizontal upper line joined with a line going down the bottom left corner .
oh that would make it more difficult . there was a field trip at school once to horseshoe falls but i was unable to attend .
the three waterfalls are horseshoe falls , the american falls , and the br ##idal veil falls .
i believe they are very close together on the canadian / us border . they dump six million cubic feet of water per minute .
the international dairy del ##i bakery association is the reason why i am familiar with del ##i bakery . good for your friend to have worked there
they represent different style of bakery . by the way , are you aware of nordic bread culture at all ?
the originate in scandinavian countries and only four grain types dominate the styles
the two oldest ones are barley and rye , ant two more recent and wheat and o ##ats . overall , nordic bread culture is considered to be pre - historic
i think wheat bread and i work at a local bakery
nope , and baking is goin ##t to be around forever , since grains have been a staple food for millennia
cookies and cakes , by the fifth and sixth centuries bce , the ancient greeks used enclosed oven ##s heated by wood fires
yeah actually greeks baked dozens and possibly hundreds of types of bread
i like making furniture for both functionality and beauty , so i guess a bit of both .
currently i ' ve been working on cupboard ##s and shelves as i want more storage . have you ever worked with wood before ?
honestly , i don ' t have the funds yet for my own tools , but borrow saw ##s and drills from a friend . they get the job done for the most part .
it is not that difficult . you just have to use the correct ingredients like flour , eggs etc .
you throw them in a bowl in the correct proportions , then put them in an oven , sort of like you would with a barbecue in a masonry oven .
it depends on the method you are using . you have to use prolonged dry heat in an oven , but it could be made even on hot ashes or stones .
it is not just an american thing . for example , the nordic culture has made cakes since prehistoric times all the way up to today . cakes have been around awhile !
for fra ##tern ##al twins each twin is fe ##rta ##lized by its own sperm cell .
yu ##p , that ' s because they have two different combinations of dna
that is actually refer ##ed to as do ##ppel ##gang ##ers !
i ' m not sure about that . i thought it was 6 !
the method of cooking baking uses is simply just letting it cook in dry heat so its quite simple , ic ##ing , decor ##ating , and mixing is where the real skill comes in .
i really like lemon or ras ##p ##berry flavor ##ings in cakes , lemon and white cake make a god ##ly combo in my opinion , so delicious .
ha ##ha , baking really is a form of art and requires a lot of skill so im always impressed by those who become baker ##s , also because they make great cakes .
im not really sure , i think their stocks are doing well though . target was actually founded by george dayton and headquartered in minneapolis , minnesota , the company was originally named good ##fell ##ow dry goods in june 1902 before being renamed the dayton ' s dry goods company in 1903 and some time later the dayton company in the year 1910 .
i guess it was named on just an idea the creators had , fun fact it was named the dayton - hudson corporation after merging with the j . l .
if i " m not mistaken it was the j ##l buchanan company .

most people dye their hair to hide gray . i did it to hide my blonde hair .
i ' ve herd something crazy like 75 % of women and 18 % of men use hair dye .
it ' s big business . in america alone hair dye is a 2 . 2 billion dollar business .
i want to look like a wood - demons , with their hair thick and shaggy like a horse ' s mane . it ' s what i ' m st ##ri ##ving to do .
yes , i have a ding ##o , which is a type of feral dog from australia . have you heard of them ?
oh , i see . great dog , but probably po ##os everywhere . don ' t they cross them with other breeds to make peek ##ap ##oo ##s or pe ##ke - a - te ##se ?
probably a good choice for your mother , since they are doc ##ile companion animals . that ' s why they call them lap - dogs .
you like them or your dog does ? lo ##l . lap dogs were some of the earliest human companions . can you imagine a pe ##kin ##ese sitting on a cave man ' s lap . lo ##fl

i love the dolphins the whole marine and ocean ##arium at the theme park is not only educational but very fun for kids even us adults lo ##l .
i love disney we go to orlando , fl as well being we live in florida so it is very close , disney world is just so magical i can ' t wait to take my daughters there to enjoy the park .
oh i totally agree disney is a vacation you have to go for days because the park is so big and the resorts are fun also i loved staying there as a kid .
the leisure is the best and most reliable part of staying at the resort especially with little kids and taking how busy it is and the package deals is great .
i have never played hide and seek ne ##rf . i mostly just stood there and shot my brother with my gun .
i remember holding my brother down and using my n - strike elite gun and just shooting him until he yelled for our parents .
i remember making my younger brother watch the scream movie back in 1996
yes , it was a classic slash ##er film . i wish more were like that .
i love all of it ! i also heard that sometimes people combine baking with grill ##ing to create a hybrid barbecue effect . strange but fascinating .
that ' s amazing . i prefer the professional touch of home baker ##s , since now most baking is automated by machines in factories .
i definitely agree ! i just found out that baking has traditionally been done by women at home , and by men in baker ##ies and restaurants . kinda sex ##ist but it ' s nice that it ' s different now .
yes exactly ! and baking is absolutely fundamental . so many foods consumed are baked , and they can be nut ##rit ##ious and at times , necessary .
the tours are fantastic , the ferry boat takes you from the southern end of the niagara gorge . to the north side , you get to see and experience everything .
im not really sure about penguins but iv ##e seen some large fish in there and that ##s about it , the sea lions are way further out on the water and don ##t hang close to the falls .
when you go be sure to visit all the three waterfalls , which are horseshoe falls , the american falls and the wonderful br ##idal veil falls . hope you have fun !
you are welcome ! iv ##e been to the smaller br ##idal veil falls which are on the united states side and its a great spot for pictures , be sure to take advantage of that !
me too , dark brown hair . but it also varies from light brown as well .
ha , good news then . brown hair tends to be thicker than fair hair .
mine too . i guess we are both what they consider brunette ##s then , which is a french word .
same here . brown hair is most common across the western world .
and i ' m sure she blame ##s hers on you ! funny how gray hair is associated with age and stress . which is it ?
she ' s a " natural " freak - one with a genetic abnormal ##ity . better that than a " made " freak who alter ##s themselves at some point .
trump hotel ? you poor man . b ##wa ##ha ##ha ##ha ##h !
trump tower in downtown chicago ?
i don ' t know what your reasons must have been . anyway ##s , a primary reason is to cover gray or white hair , to change to a color regarded as more fashionable or desirable
of course , i have some white hair as well , i usually do it at home with the help of my loving wife and sometimes through the services of a professional at a salon
oh well , there is no big deal about doing this . about $ 1 . 9 billion was spent for this alone in 2011 in usa
even history has it even celtic people did it as told by di ##od ##orus sic ##ulus
target is the second largest corporation , behind wal ##mart .
km ##art ' s peak was in 2000 , and it operated 217 ##1 stores . their fall from grace did not take long after that .
our local km ##art shut down . in 2005 there were only 141 ##6 km ##arts left .
sears is another store that has had a massive drop in physical locations . there are only 1100 sears retail locations left .
arc welding is fairly striking to me . gas tung ##sten arc welding can produce great we ##ld ##s
arc welding involves using metal to join metal via electricity and heat
it can be very useful in fu ##sing certain materials . it also provides energy that is necessary in the heating process
thor is an interesting superhero > i think his hammer was welded by the gods !
sailors have lots of super ##sti ##tions that are specific to being a marine ##r . do you know of any of those super ##sti ##tions ?
yes , i believe it is - red sky at morning , sailor ' s take warning too .
why is six afraid of seven ? because seven eight nine . . . wow , that ' s a classic .
fiction is used in so many formats too like writings , live performances , films , television programs , animation ##s , video games
fiction is sometimes used as just literary narrative though
fiction is so cool though , pure creative imagination .
id love to write fi ##cit ##on myself
really , mine is black , but people with brown hair are often referred to as brunette
maybe , i have observed that brown hair is common in the western world
i don ##t think , it is common among australian ab ##ori ##gin ##es and mel ##ane ##sian ##s
yes maybe , because it is characterized by higher levels of the dark pigment
many people see jazz music as classic music .
it started in the form of independent traditional and popular music styles
that is is true . it is linked by the common bond of african american and european americans
" war of the worlds " written by h g wells and starring tom cruise is a favorite !
not sure ? another good one is invasion of the body snatch ##ers from 1959
war of the worlds was about aliens invading earth and ex ##ter ##minating humans to take the planet
no i don ' t but i know about alien invasions and space invasion lo ##l
well , the first one opened in 1962 . they were briefly in canada , i ' m so sad it didn ' t work out .
target ' s failure in the canadian market was a down ##turn for them , but they have experienced rev ##ital ##ization lately .
target has expanded in the urban markets in the us , rev ##ital ##izing business .
yeah it ' s great and was originally founded in minnesota in 1902
i ' m not sure , but they ' ve experienced a lot of growth since 2010 .
some stores do , but they are really known for their cheap - chi ##c cloth ##s .
yes , child care providers are our children ##s first teacher , if you think about it . . besides us as the par ##em ##ts .
in north carolina you have to be licensed by the state to watch two or more kids unrelated to you for more then 4 hours a day .
yep ! north carolina is the 9th most populous state in america . beautiful place to be with kids !
well pasta is traditional italian cuisine , so you did try it : ) the first reference of pasta is dating to 115 ##4 in sicily
fresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand but today many varieties of fresh pasta are commercially produced by machines
i bet ! i actually want to try to make my own fresh pasta fr ##es ##ca
i just had pasta with meat ##balls the other day . i ' ve read pasta can be made with flour from other cereal ##s or grains
which way do you prepare your pasta for cooking , as most dried pasta are commercially produced
fresh pasta is usually produced with machines , and turned by hand
in italy specific pasta shapes are ind ##ic ##ti ##tv ##e of the region in which a person lives
i am not sure but , the red colour of blood comes from protein hem ##og ##lo ##bin
the iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet mars
reds range from the brilliant yellow - tinged scarlet and ve ##rmi ##lli ##on to blu ##ish - red crimson which is really cool
i don ' t think the cause is fully understood . it could be genetic , could be biological , or it could be psychological .
i ' m sure it is , but people are starting to see that behavioral therapy and a slow increase in activity can help counter ##act the effects .
that seems to be the case . it also looks like evidence has shown that there ' s no adverse effects from trying to counter ##act the effects of cf ##s , which is good .
hopefully . as long as you get the essential nutrition , like fluids and protein , you should see decent results no matter what .
i love the poly ##rh ##yt ##hm ##s and improvisation . also the swing and blues influences .
it ' s probably so great because it originated in african american communities in new orleans .
funk is also from new orleans , the famous funk band the meters originated in new orleans .
did you participate in co ##sp ##lay ? what is your character of choice ?
i have no idea who those characters are . if i dressed in co ##sp ##lay , i would definitely be sailor moon - - probably the only anime i ever watched
sailor moon of course ! i watched the anime ##s rather than read the manga ##s
no it ' s pretty ancient . it became more of a " think ##g " in the 14th century and has gotten more and more popular since .
i ' m not sure . but since it has such a temperate and mediterranean climate , it is really great for growing grapes . i guess that ' s why it ' s always been known for it .
well , white wine is primarily from green or yellowish grapes .
i am not 100 % sure on that however , i do know that it was founded by enzo ferrari and the company built its first car in 1940 .
not 100 % sure on that , either but brand finance rated the car the worlds most powerful car in 2014 . that is awesome and i think i need a ferrari . lo ##l
i would place my bet on the lamb ##o being the tough ##est competitor . and , come to think of it i will take either car . or heck , why not both ? in my dreams lo ##l
i think i ' m going to have mine done by a professional hair ##dre ##sser ,
celtic people used to dye their hair blonde .
they used to do this naturally by washing it in lime and comb ##ing it back .
some of them were clean shave ##n , but some shaved everything except for a shaggy mustache .
i like baking garlic bread and then also combining it with grill ##ing to produce a hybrid variant by using one method after the other .
it ' s best when you use a french bag ##uet ##te and slice it only partially downwards , allowing the con ##diment ##s to so ##ak in . i am making myself hungry as well .
i am sure you can find something very ta ##sty at the bakery . there will be baked goods prepared by a baker .
i enjoy mexican bread ##s also , although they are the result of experimentation influenced by various european baking traditions .
from what i remember around 118 ##4 is when it ' s first mentioned anywhere so around then i guess , pretty long time
honestly i ' m unsure of the oldest but i do know that people used to make in a sheep ' s stomach so it ' s probably been around for awhile before 118 ##4
i remember watching a tv show with go ##rdan ramsey going around eating local food , and he watched someone make , and eat , it so i think some still do
i ' m fairly sure he does it much less than he used to . he had 2 seasons of a show where he would go to say africa and visit and eat in every country . i really liked anthony bo ##ur ##dai ##n too , was really sad about his death
it has a wave ##len ##ght that starts at 625 nano ##met ##res .
i like sports cars also , the term sports car was first used in london in 1919 .
it is a primary color in the r ##gb color mode .
i own a 1962 ferrari 250 gt ##o , most expensive car in history !
the fact that it was powered by ferrari ' s tip ##o 168 / 62 v ##12 engine . a very powerful engine indeed !
its top speed is not very well known , since only 39 250 gt ##os were manufactured between 1962 and 1964 .
i got more into baking after watching the great british ba ##ke off . i loved seeing the different challenges and guessing who would be eliminated .
the great british ba ##ke off is very different from american cooking shows . it ' s all really friendly , there isn ' t any drama .
it is ! the stars of the show are the hosts - mary and sue ! you ' re going to love them .
do it ! glee is also on netflix , highly recommend checking that one out too ! it ' s about a high school glee club .
pasta is typically made from un ##lea ##ved dough of a dar ##um wheat flour mixed with water or eggs .
it was developed through centuries but it changed significantly with the discovery of the new world .
fresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand or with the aid of a pasta maker . but now ##dad ##ys you can just buy it at your supermarket
you can ba ##ke it or boil it . if boiling be sure to add some salt to the water . its best when its slightly under ##co ##oked , or al dent ##e .
it influenced many foods around the world , chiefly foods of the united states . it ' s copied all over the world .
my list of water sports include over water ones like skiing and wake ##boarding . there are underwater and in water ones also .
for under water water sports you can learn how to scuba dive .
it is a very fun water sport . you can even participate in boat racing . that seems to reckless for me though .
for a list of water sports , some people participate in tri ##athlon ##s which includes swimming .
apparently the red in a sunset is the result of ray ##leigh scattering .
it ' s a pretty complicated term but it involves the scattering of light by part ##ical ##es much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation .
no really it only occurs when light rave ##ls through transparent solids , li ##gui ##ds or gases
well , it ' s a dominant trait , so i guess it ' s pretty common
red hair is pretty rare . . . just 1 - 2 % of humans . makes for good ginger jokes though
i just know northern european . probably irish
well it ' s found world - wide , but more common in asia ##m east europe , latin america , and africa
judging by the fact that they are always well made , and tend to be hard and dry , i would say they are healthy
i ' m not too sure but i like dog biscuits because they come in a flat bone - shape .
you won ' t believe it if i tell you that some manufacturers of the bis ##cuit thinks clean the dog ' s teeth , promoting oral health .
i doubt , you might have also heard of " dog ' s bread " , made from bran , they say this have been in existence for over a 1000 years
i like rock a lot better even though it was influenced by jazz . it was also influenced by the " british invasion " in 1964 .
ha ##ha , yes they did . however the british invasion in the 1960s was due to counter ##culture in the united states .
counter ##culture is when a sub ##culture whose values differ substantially from the mainstream culture .
its a is a cult quebec comic book series featuring fbi ’ s crazed rogue agent , steve “ red ” ke ##tch ##up .
more so , primary color in the r ##gb color model and the cm ##yk color model , and is the complementary color of cy ##an .
cy ##an ( or ) is greenish - blue
actually the cheese originates from go ##uda , netherlands , so that ##s how it got its name ! but i agree , it does taste go ##ud !
i think go ##uda cheese can be anywhere , it is only named after the city where it was historically traded
actually , the first mention of go ##uda cheese has been observed to be as far back as 118 ##4 ! so it is one of the oldest recorded cheese ever made !
you ' re right , american cheese is rather recent . it only started becoming popular in the 1800s !
it ' s been popular for a long time . the bright red outfits of renaissance nobility were dyed using cochin ##eal .
it ' s a parasite , found in tropical and subtropical south america , mexico and arizona . they live on the prick ##ly pear cactus .
another parasite which was used to make red dye is the ke ##rm ##es , made in a similar way as cochin ##eal .
do you have a favorite hue of red ? like pink ##s to dark red burgundy ? mine is a dark red .
yeah , more of a shade of red and more like its own color . i wonder why pink feels more like its own color than dark red .
i could see that . do you believe that pink references the feminine emotions like innocence and cha ##sti ##ty ?
i do wonder if that is a world wide phenomena , or if such a perceived notion of innocence with the color pink is only prevalent in western societies .
i probably wouldn ' t . i ' m happy with black hair . although , hair coloring is definitely on the rise , as 75 % of women and 18 % of men in copenhagen , for example , have reported dying their hair , if that gives you any indication .
i ' m not so sure . but i understand if you would want to , in order to stand out . especially if you lived in asia , eastern europe , latin america , southern europe , or africa , no matter what your et ##hn ##olin ##gui ##stic affiliation , you most likely have black hair as it ' s overwhelmingly common .
ah , that ' s interesting . and even though you have black hair , you can still be quite different . the range of skin colors that go along with black hair is still really vast , as you can have either the pale ##st of light skin to the darkest tones of dark skin . it ' s a wide spectrum , so there ' s still variability in appearance .
jazz originated in the late 19th century
not much info on that but jazz since the 1920 ' s age ja ##z has been recognized as a major form of musical expression
not much information . but jazz is the swing of blue notes , call and response vocals
one popular musician is miles dewey dave ##s ll ##l he was an american jazz trumpeter
i don ' t know for sure , but i tend to like music that emphasizes the vocal pieces .
do you like the beach boys ? they ' re from 1961 .
mike love of the beach boys once said of their musical style : " don ' t f % # $ with the formula . " they must have known they had something good .
yeah i often listen to an oldies radio station that plays mostly classic rock from he 1950 ' s - 1970 ' s .
no but i have been listening to him since 1993 when he was discovered by dr dr ##e
i love the album " the chronic " . i like every song .
he was born in 1971 . so 46 years old .
i do not but i know he has sold over 23 million albums in the us .
nothing wrong with gray hair ! it ' s di ##sti ##ng ##uising . brown hair can vary from light brown to almost black hair
brown hair is actually thicker than that of lighter hair but not as think as red hair .
yeah that is probably the case . additionally , brown hair is common among australian ab ##ori ##gin ##es
there ' s lots to see there , besides the falls . there ' s observation towers , high - rise hotels , so ##uven ##ir shops , casinos and theatres . i love the casino !
i ' m not sure ! but i do know that more than six million cubic feet of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute .
wow , that must have been scary ! which one did you go down ? the horseshoe falls , the american falls or the br ##idal veil falls ?
