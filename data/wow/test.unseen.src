i haven ' t been around for long enough to have seen that . its ##pop ##ular too , discovery channel is the third most distributed on cab ##el even now that the channel is a little bit dumb ?
a little bit dumb ? ye ##a well it pan ##ders now so it makes sense that the discovery channel is a bad tc network i ' ve noticed that with the history channel as well as t ##lc .
. bad of late but they will do great one day . they had a great run in the 1990 ' s . plus , now that new stadium is rather impressive hopefully they can live up to it .
it . yes one day our offense will do great things with the football . running , passing our way to victory . ha , well now that the tony rom ##o era has ended that is more likely .

the band guns n ' roses ? they are my favorite band ever sure the band was formed inn 1985 in los angeles , california . what is tour favorite album ? id say my favorite is appetite for destruction
very popular , the band was formed by rose ’ s band , hollywood rose , and tr ##ac ##ii guns ’ s band , l . a . guns , that ##s where they got their name from .
of the best selling artists of all time . indeed among the best , i believe that steven adler was the first to leave the band , getting kicked out in 1990 when his drug abuse got out of control
very talented , he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s . rumor had it that the sound engineer bob clear ##mount ##ain said ax ##l rose “ would threaten to quit the band three times a week . ”
been to a nickel ##back concert but i really do like nickel ##back are you aware of who the members of the band are the lead singer was very funny during the set , i forget his name though .
during the set , i forget his name though . i wasn ' t aware at first but nickel ##back is not american there originating from canada i didn ' t know that either . do they tour there ?
canada i didn ' t know that either . do they tour there ? i think the lead guitarist his name might be nick k ##ro ##ger or something like that k ##ro ##ger sounds familiar . chad maybe ?
elvis presley hello , i love to listen to elvis , do you ? he is the king of rock n roll yes , i love classic rock , especially from the 50 ##s .
yes , i love classic rock , especially from the 50 ##s . yes me to classic rock is the best ! rock n roll experience magazine showcases classic bands sometimes can you tell me more about that magazine ?
experience magazine showcases classic bands sometimes can you tell me more about that magazine ? they started in 1992 , and have done colorful interviews with bands like kiss that ' s cool . have they covered other topics ?
, do old people usually go bowling ? yeah , its sort of an older persons activity like bingo , it ' s not so much that younger people can ##t do it , its just not the primary audience
of the band let ' s go bowling ? it ' s a ska band from california . i love ska but surprisingly i ' ve never heard of them , i have heard bowling for soup though lo ##l
though lo ##l i ' ve never heard of bowling for soup lo ##l . let ' s go bowling performed on events along with pearl jam , no doubt , goo goo dolls and many many more . bowling
band ' s traditional ska style helped set the standards for dress and culture for west coast ska . i love all of those bands , format ##ive years were spent jam ##min them , alt rock is the best
starts with the offense , their goal is to get it into the end ##zone . it seems like it stops so much for commercials . i like soccer because you get to see a game not a thousand advertisements
thousand advertisements oh i can understand that , advertising is so frustrating unless they are super bowl commercials . i like to watch red ##zone on sunday ' s ever heard of it ? no , what is that ?
red ##zone is a channel that shows all of the games happening concurrently , with no commercials . they only show the big plays from all of the games . that sounds awesome - how do you get that ?
skiing skiing is a pretty fun sport , but interesting ##ly enough , it ' s also got a history of nearly 5 millennia . five ! wow ! i wonder where it originated ?
thought . that makes sense . maybe my scandinavian ancestry is why i ' m ok at skiing . not downhill , though , only cross country . do you think genetics has much to do with skiing abilities ?

i really like the harry potter franchise harry potter chronicles the life of harry potter and his friends . i really think that harry potter should not have been the main character though
and his friends . i really think that harry potter should not have been the main character though the story concerns harry ' s battle with lord vol ##de ##mo ##rt . yes , but harry was a horrible protagonist
not so much the tone as it is the fact that harry was w ##hin ##y and would constantly put his friends and the entire hog ##wart ##s school at risk . he had no connection with others ' perspectives
connection with others ' perspectives well , the books have more than 500 copies sold worldwide , so some disagree . i think that statement , while correct , is highly under ##sell ##ing the popularity of the book .
sport in which the participant uses ski ##s to glide on snow . i have only went skiing once and loved it ! it was really hard though . i imagine it takes a lot of practice , right ?
leg the skier wore a long straight non - arching ski for sliding and on the other a shorter ski for kicking . that ' s interesting . i have never seen that before . when was skiing invented ?
have never seen that before . when was skiing invented ? earliest history were found in russia and date to 6000 bce . i would never have guessed that ! was it invented for practical purposes or just recreation ?
for practical purposes or just recreation ? first depiction of a skier with two ski poles dates to 1741 . i imagine it makes travel on snow much easier ! what were the early ski ##s made out of ?
in the situation because of physical geography yes , i am most times emotionally unstable , i wonder if true love exists ? where you love each other all the way down , and no on and off again .
no on and off again . did you ever go back to your partner for comfort ? yes , totally , it sac ##eres me being alone , without her but sometimes we don ##t get alone that well !

the walking dead ( tv series ) have you seen the tv series " the walking dead " an american post - apocalyptic thriller . yes , but it ' s garbage .

d to death because of that role . i liked it when he awake ##ns from a coma to find the world that he new is now overrun by zombies . zombies are pretty terrifying . would you agree ?
they are fictional . the thought of of the undead or the re ##ani ##mation of the human corpse that feeds of the living creep ##s me out . i would let one of them eat me up inside .

i love american football don ##t you ? i do too ! it ' s a great team sport played on a rectangular field between two goal ##post ##s . i think my favorite team is the cowboys
this against me , but i like the patriots . they seem to always be the team with the most points at the end of the game . they are still a good team even though they had that controversy
they had that controversy yes , they have . tom brady is my favorite player . he is one of only two players to have won 5 super bowls . yeah it is just terrible about all that stuff though

dave matthews band , but i actually really dig some of his solo performances . fa ##ve 1990s rock song of all is bitter sweet symphony by the verve . loved older classics like bohemian rap ##ho ##dy by queen

apples are good , but red apples are a bit more sweet , i like that fruit a bit more i wonder if there is really any nutritional difference between red and green apples . i would think not .
like green , it reminds me of trees since it is the color between blue and yellow ! it makes me think of spring and summer , when the grass is nice and green and the trees are full .
green and the trees are full . quite poetic aren ' t you ? i think that ##s because it is formed by light which has a dominant wavelength so it is green from the way we process it ?
the way we process it ? exactly , it is created by a combination of yellow and blue which our eyes per ##cie ##ve . real scientific , i guess that is why there are different shades of green .

it was easy to get motivated to act on desires and needs people wouldn ##t struggle with it yes good point . i guess i should just give up and accept that i don ' t have any motivation .
will * absolutely * argue that it should be classified as an intense athletic physical activity ! you know i ' ve never thought about it before , but yes , you are right - it ' s intense !
- - but competitive routines include tumbling , dance , jumps , cheers , and " stunt ##ing " . a lot ! wow , very impressive . how long did it take you to learn all those moves ?

with the intent of doing so . and then release them . but isn ' t that really cruel ? they have no idea what is happening and don ' t know that you won ' t hurt them .
. people trap them not to be cruel but to relocate them somewhere else . ok , fair enough . as long as there is some reason behind it that doesn ##t harm the animal then that is ok .
. me either . i would only be willing to try it for its most common purposes , food or removing dangerous predators . same here , though a lot of people seem to do it for recreation right ?
for recreation right ? yes , that ' s also a very common practice . another common use is pest control . that ' s true . hunting has been around for a while , i ' m sure .

dog training well lets talk about our furry little friend the dog , and the history of dog training . sounds good to me , talking about dogs is always an interesting topic
. sounds good to me , talking about dogs is always an interesting topic first with history , training dogs goes all the way back to roman times at least . either for hunting or helping around the household ?
little house dogs did not arrive till about the 1950s due to suburban ##ization where we wanted to train dogs to be good household pets . i guess before that they were mostly trained as hunting or farm dogs .
with their environment and a human creates that environment . so if the dog isn ' t well trained its the humans to blame . its amazing how well a dog can be trained just to get that little treat

, but those in character seem to love it . i haven ' t had the pleasure to see it in person . i think that ' s neat . would you consider dressing up and playing the part ?
don ' t really like the books . that ##s the author john ray gr ##isha ##m jr . , born february 8 , 1955 . i am the same way . i prefer the movies over the books ,
8 , 1955 . i am the same way . i prefer the movies over the books , he ' s books though have been published worldwide and translated into 42 languages . that is a lot of languages .

to this day . you can go on an inca road tour , where you walk the roads . of course , there are 25 , 000 miles of them , so you won ' t see them all .
