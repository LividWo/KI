modern skiing came from scandinavia , but it was thought to originally come from china , as seen in ancient paintings . who would ' ve thought .
hmm i ' m not sure , maybe ! you should petition the ski and snow ##board association and cross country ski canada to research this line of questioning !
unfortunately no . it just requires more balance than my body is capable of even imagining .

i was never a big fan of the dave matthews band , but i actually really dig some of his solo performances .
i was so excited when the verve reformed , but it ' s too bad they couldn ' t keep it together for very long .

i see , i have a flat wooden or other synthetic surface in my house so i can bowl in the privacy of my home !

it must be very popular to have sold more than 500 million copies around the world . it has been translated to 73 languages !
i see , his friends her ##mo ##ine grange ##r and ron we ##as ##ley and they must go that hog ##wart ##s school

well way back in history , archery was less a sport and more a means of hunting and combat .
well i ' m not sure how old it is , but i know that in latin it is known as " arc ##us " .
usually an archer or bowman would hunt small game like rabbits .
i have tried both . i was better at snow skiing than water skiing . i think for water skiing i wasn ##t strong enough to hold myself up .
i did at va ##il ski ##t resort . that was many years ago . i haven ' t had a chance to go back . maybe once i move up north i can try again .
i have wanted to get into yoga just to help with my mental ##ity . i have heard it is ve ##r med ##itating .

i took classes in high school before getting my diploma .
not so much drawing but learning to code . most game designers have bachelor degrees .

not only that , it has a long tradition as the color of ireland culture as well !
i think both kinds of apples are good , but red apples are a bit more sweet , i like that fruit a bit more
i am not sure , i would think they would be very tiny differences though , as they are the same type of fruit
quite poetic aren ' t you ? i think that ##s because it is formed by light which has a dominant wavelength
exactly , it is created by a combination of yellow and blue which our eyes per ##cie ##ve .
yes and by far the largest contributor to green in nature is ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l , which you see in trees and plants
med ##ica ##al ill ##ing is essential in usa . and also health insurance is ve ##y important for all . we need to claim with insurance company and rec ##ie the payment

they became quite popular ! they ' ve had a few drummer changes in the early 2000s , but i still love them and their sound , now .
they went through drummer changes from 1995 to 2005 . i think the drummer now is ada ##ir , and he replaced ryan vi ##ked ##al .
ah yes ! the lead vocalist is chad k ##ro ##eger , and the backing vocalist is ryan peak ##e . great voices !
i haven ' t heard about the backs ##tory on how they were discovered . do you happen to know the history ?

a well - known variant of " t ##wee ##ning " is the pose ##r stroke ##r
even when people have action or desires it still hard to get motivated
well its hard you need something to prompt you to act to get motivated to do it so you actually can act
i think if it was easy to get motivated to act on desires and needs people wouldn ##t struggle with it
motivation is something i hope i find someday ha ##ha
i mean , obviously it * depends * - - but competitive routines include tumbling , dance , jumps , cheers , and " stunt ##ing " . a lot !
i loved gymnastics from the time i was 3 . dance , too . i mean , being here int the u . s . means it ' s big - - and big business . there are like 1 . 5 million participants in all - star cheerleading !
no worries - - it feels a bit silly now , as i ' m an adult - - but basically it ' s competitive cheerleading . prior to 1987 , teams like that were placed in the same divisions that rep ##ped schools and sports leagues .
kevin sy ##ts ##rom and mike k ##rie ##ger in 2010
you have to register as a user to up ##load photos
not sure how many members but it is owned now by facebook
well the bank nickel ##back is from hanna , alberta canada and their lead singer and guitarist is chad k ##ro ##eger

a few words show up in chinese documents from 3rd century then nothing until 8th century , strange huh ?
yes and old records indicate chinese had a lot of influence on early japanese language
not sure ? i know they ended a self imposed isolation from the world in 1853
i learned most about colors as a kid while using cr ##ayo ##la cr ##ayo ##ns . can you believe cr ##ayo ##la has been around since 1903 ?
it is funny to think that they started with just one color . . . it was called the black st ##ao ##nal marking cr ##ayo ##n
well they started out as a pigment supply company . then they shifted gears to school and house products like chalk and cr ##ayo ##ns
well they sure did expand from the one color . they now have over 200 varieties
harry potter consists of seven different fantasy novels .
harry potter follows , you guessed it , harry potter and his friends like her ##mi ##one and ron .
yep ! harry potter and his friends go on adventures at hog ##wart ##s .
there are many types of deer around the world that are hunted for food . they give us ve ##nis ##on .
the white - tailed deer is native to the united states as are some other var ##ities .
in north america , white - tailed deer are widely distributed east of the rocky mountains .
in the americas , white - tailed deer are the most widely distributed type . i ' m not sure how many offspring each year , but i believe it is 1 - 3 .
that sounds really cool . i know that ra ##zer makes lots of green products , i bet those are your favorites eh ?
well most many plants and also creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green color as a camouflage .
they sure do , i know that in nature plants are green because of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l , the chemical by which plants photos ##yn ##thes ##ize and convert sunlight into chemical energy . plants are the most abundant green objects on earth .
you are welcome ! one last fact is that ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is absolutely essential in photos ##yn ##thesis , its what allows plants to absorb energy from sunlight .
not sure , but they are knit ##ted so i ' m guessing lots of different materials can be used .
they can be machine or hand knit ##ted .
coco chan ##el actually po ##ular ##ized them , because she didn ' t like how tight - neck ##ed sweater ##s messed up her hair when removing them .
i imagine it is not as bad not that there is en ##chan ##ced 911 so para ##med ##ics only have to go to the calls they are absolutely nec ##ces ##sar ##y for
in winnipeg they have was is known as the winnipeg fire para ##med ##ic ser ##vic , or w ##fp ##s . 6th ##ey have 2 different para ##med ##ic divisions depending on the type of 911 call .
\ it started in 1882 with the winnipeg fire department and grew from there .
it is from our view point but not in the grand scheme of things .
green is actually the color in between blue and yellow on the visible light spectrum
ha ##ha how very true ! the largest contributor to green in nature is ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l , a chemical which plants use to convert sunlight into chemical energy .
many animals have also adapted a green hue in order to camouflage in their gee ##n environments .
usually amazon and target . i love how i can shop from anywhere , my phone , laptop , my tablet . po ##ssi ##bil ##ites are endless .
not really , what is that ? is it an online store where i look at pictures of the products , see prices and specifications ?
with amazon ' s search engine i can search any kind of model or brand and i ' m not limited like some stores .
jeff be ##zos founded amazon long ago . i guess you don ' t do much online shopping ?
founded in detroit in 1989 , i
the duo has earned two platinum , with 5 golden album
interesting ##ly , the entire catalog of the group has sold 6 . 5 million units in the united states and canada .
the duo founded the independent record label psycho ##pathic records with alex ab ##bis ##s as manager , and produced and starred in the feature films " big money hu ##st ##las
oh okay . so northern ireland is actually still part of the united kingdom right ?
have you ever visited there ?
i would too . it looks so beautiful .
yes and the low - lying mountains are stunning !
what platforms do you design games for - - pcs , video game consoles , etc . ?
seems like there has been much growth for ios devices like the ipad .
yep , and new the ipad is the second - most popular kind of tablet . apple knows what they are doing !
i ' m not sure , but i do know that he graduated from ms state university and went to the ms school of law in 1981
he has a bunch ! the chamber , the client , a painted house , the pe ##lica ##n brief , the runaway jury , a time to kill !
yes , and the firm was his first top seller , selling over 7 million copies !
well , back in 2012 , gr ##isha ##m ' s books had sold over 275 million copies !
he scope of practice of a para ##med ##ic differs for countries ,
in most countries , the profession is a protected title and accountable to a professional regulatory body
it is very closely related to other healthcare positions , especially the emergency medical technician role
i am knowledge ##able . in bowling your target is to knock all pins in the lane .
if you will make a strike when you don ' t hit any pins .
you are right . i made a typing error . a strike is when all the pins are knocked down .
you can get a maximum score of 300 . you do this by getting 12 strikes in a row .
i am certain the ski ##s then were much different than today .
the oldest examples of ski ##s came from russia and have been dated close to 6000 bce .
do you enjoy the skiing that takes place at the olympics ?
for one it is one of the major forms of throwing sports and i think a lot of people enjoy it
well a strike is when you knock down all pins on the first round
you will need to get three strikes in a row that is a turkey
i love first first book " a time to kill , " was published in june 1989 ,
his first books have sold over 275 million copies worldwide
i am not sure but i can tell you that a time to kill his book was adapted into a 1993 feature film of the same name , starring tom cruise ,
the philosopher nelson goodman described it .
that is is ir ##real . meaning that it can be un ##real .
just that it can be a position in a field .
yes like science in an electron field .
i ' m not sure how many seasons exactly but i know its a lot . also , there are 2 tv series , 6 novels , video games and audio books , all walking dead related .
my favorite character is rick grimes , played by actor andrew lincoln . he is awesome .
he is the main character . he wakes up from a coma to find the world taken over by zombies . he then goes on a mission to find other survivors , fighting zombies along the way .
you have to stab them through the head or the heart i believe . i stopped watching the show a few seasons back .
i bet both could work out , if you are really good you probably don ' t need education
i bet it would help a great deal , but game design can also just be creating goals , rules and challenges to define a board game , card game , etc
i bet it does , it is definitely worth looking into , it is a current research topic in meta ##des ##ing
that is true but we always have to watch out for excessive hunting . it has caused some species to become endangered .
agreed , i remember reading one time that unless you plan to kill the animal its not considered hunting .
yeah hunting is a great way to feed your family and control the pest and predators in the wild .
i know each team has eleven players and they have goal ##post ##s at each end of the rectangular field
they score points by getting the ball into the other teams goal ##post
i a not sure but which ever team has the most points when time runs out wins the game : )
ski ##ttle ##s is an old european lawn game , kinda like ten - pen bowling .
yes it is ! it is a popular indoor place game .
in catalonia has a version and it is called " bit ##les " . it is not as popular in present times .
catalonia is located in il ##ber ##ian peninsula . barcelona , the capital " is one of 4 provinces .
i need to take a class . i would like to be able to knock down all the pins at once and get a strike , or at least knock them down in two tries and get a spare .
i ' m terrible so i ' d probably get 15 out of the maximum score of 300 . ha ##ha ! i usually go with family and friends about twice a year .
even if i suck at bowling , i like the am ##bian ##ce of a bowling alley and i ' ve always wanted to go behind the automated machines that set up the pins at the end of the lane .
apparently before there were machines , there was an actual person called a pins ##ette ##r that would pick up and arrange all the pins that have been knocked over and give the balls back to the players .
motivation as a desire to perform an action that you rather not , so you need to find the reason why , and hopefully change your mind : d
the " wanting behavior " associated with a reward ##ing stimulus can be increased by micro ##in ##ject ##ions of do ##pa ##mine , so you need to be happy to be motivated also : d
yes , you need to start from yourself , motivation is the reason for people ' s actions
i ' m the same way . i do like the filters that i can add to my photos in ins ##tagram though ! it ' s fun to play around with them .
i never realized that ins ##tagram is owned by facebook , did you ?
yes , that ' s one of the things i like about ins ##tagram . i can use my account to share to my other social media profiles . it ' s easy !
i have to admit , it did take me awhile to get used to reading and adding hash ##tag ##s to my posts ! but i like brows ##ing hash ##tag ##s to discover new content .
well they had a bill creating the first national park , yellowstone , was signed into law by president ulysses s . grant in 1872 . so that is probably the most loved
i have been to big bend in texas . i learned in school the organic act of 1916 created the national park service " to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife there ##in
im really not sure but many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments .
same ! seven national parks ( including six in alaska ) are paired with a national preserve and those are really pretty
i ' m not surprised that he writes crime novels since he practiced criminal law for about a decade
it certainly does pay to write about what you know about since his first bestseller , " the firm " , sold more than seven million copies !
ah , yes . . . tom cruise ! so handsome ! he ' s been nominated for three academy awards and has won three golden globe awards !
if you get three strikes in a row , it is called a turkey
yeah , and less known , a bag ##ger is what you call four consecutive strikes
yeah , it is either a bag ##ger or a ham ##bone , which is a bit more common for four strikes
not that i am aware of , those things sort of just happen
do you up ##load many photos and videos ?
originally , ins ##tagram only allowed photos as a square , that was changed in 2015 , when it started allowing full size pictures .
i agree , and you can add has ##tag to your posts , linking them to other content in ins ##tagram that is related .
you can also ap ##lly various digital filters to your pictures , but i don ' t use that feature that much
is the scoring the same as in ten - pin bowling ?
apparently the scoring is very different . pin counts don ' t roll over and only total pin knock ##down ##s count towards the score .
in ten - pin , the ball is called a " bowler " . heavier " bowler ##s " are used by pro ##s because they , statistical ##ly , will knock over more pins .
so its like a sweater , open in the front , its often tied like a robe
so coco chan ##el made them popular because she hated how traditional over the head sweater ##s messed up her hair
ye ##a its mostly associated with college st ##ide ##nts in the 20s but ba ##cam ##e popular recently in the 90s
of course , the word itself is from a we ##ls ##ch place named ce ##red ##ig ##ion
they are from los angeles .
they are famous cause of the lead singer ax ##l rose .
he is great but lead guitarist slash is really good also .
it was launched in october 2010 . i think it was mostly just for editing photos then . at least that ##s all i thought it was .
it ' s a social media app that allows people to not just edit , but also share them with all kinds of people .
very . . . and it ' s owned by facebook . . . which is pretty weird to me .
well about 6 . 6 million people liver there , making it the second most populous island in europe .
tech ##ically it has two , dublin and belfast . this is because ireland is divided into two different countries . the republic of ireland , and northern ireland .
no . not ##her ##n ireland was established in 1998 as part of the good friday agreement .
it is a very complex agreement but in essen ##se it was to encourage deco ##mm ##iss ##ion ##ing of weapons and establishing sovereignty . they were trying to stop a war .
oh yes i do . have you joined the association of chartered certified accountants
yes you are right . that is meant for the united states . it is founded in 1887
yes i am one of the 200 , 000 members
do you like eating it ? it can be very fl ##ak ##y and dense .
apparently , cod are used as a good source of vitamin a , d and e
they do , they can be used for fish and chips too , have you had that ?
me too , a little too much sometimes .
that ' s awesome . espn has broadcast international cheerleading competitions . it ' s a serious sport .
they have to be very athletic to do all those components of tumbling , jumps , dance , and stunt moves !
good luck to her ! it ' s become so popular in america , apparently about 1 . 5 million participants are involved . very cool !
i ' ve never had one . what are they ?
i love mustard and re ##lish !
re ##lish is great ! it is a cooked and pick ##led product of chopped ve ##gg ##ies !

interesting ##ly , it ' s our body ' s fault that we feel this way . the social attachment system uses pain to encourage humans to maintain their close relationships by causing pain when those relationships are lost .
sadly , nothing i could say would make you feel better . i suggest trying things to get your mind off it . good luck to you .
i hear composite bows take a long time to make , but they are strong and good for hunting
i know there ' s a thing called a crossbow that shoots bolts and quarrel ##s
very similar to a bow and arrow set . the earliest crossbow ##s were found in china
well not all hunting is about killing you can usually just trap the animal , or track them with the intent of doing so . and then release them .
well most hunters like to use a special device to remotely catch an animal like an electronically controlled cage trap . people trap them not to be cruel but to relocate them somewhere else .
indeed , i never condo ##ne animal cruelty , and if i take a shot i always do it right and make it an instant death , the meat is never wasted , we eat all of it .
yes , that ' s also a very common practice . another common use is pest control .
i ' m sure it has too . that ' s probably why excessive hunting of some species has led to end ##anger ##ment and extinction . now , however , they have laws in place to protect some animals .
not completely ex ##ter ##minated . they almost became extinct though , but it was a combination of hunting and disease . thanks to parks and reserves , populations are increasing .
a lot of herbal con ##co ##ctions were used to help with strength and st ##amina .
i ' m not really sure . body ##building has been around for a long time . eugen sand ##ow was the first in the west .
he didn ' t want to go into the military so he traveled and became a circus athlete .
my eight month old daughter picked up a hairy bum ##ble ##bee the other day and it stung her palm , i was so upset .
you probably had to go to the hospital after being stung . too bad the bum ##ble ##bee from transformers couldn ' t have driven you .
opt ##imus prime has to be the best transform ##er . the new movies with shia lab ##eo ##uf were excellent .
michael bay directed the one with shia and i prefer mark wah ##lberg as an actor . i wonder why they switched actors like that .
and the variation ! different meat ##s , con ##diment ##s , and so many ways of preparing it !
i think everything pretty much right out of a barbecue . like my burger ##s !
i can ' t believe those people that eat it with no bun ##s ! it ' s not the same . especially a home made bun or roll .
ever tried hot cross bun ##s ? they ' re mostly popular in uk , australia , new zealand , especially during holidays .
motivation can also repeat itself . it is ones way to behavior . its what causes the repeating of a certain behavior .
you need to find a motive for motivation . a motive prompt ##s someone to act a certain way .

they study motivation . do ##pa ##mine plays integral part in motivation . it increases a reward ##ing stimulus associated with the " wanting behavior " .

first with history , training dogs goes all the way back to roman times at least .
well that brings up an interesting point , our cute little house dogs did not arrive till about the 1950s due to suburban ##ization where we wanted to train dogs to be good household pets .
absolutely , listen a dog learns from his interactions with their environment and a human creates that environment . so if the dog isn ' t well trained its the humans to blame .
sure , that is a form of classical conditioning where the dog learns to associate between two stimuli . treat for an desired action .
they perform rock music they have a lead vocalist who is my favorite chad and as guitarist and drummer of course .
their most famous song was a top billboard it is called how you remind me a good classic rock song .
that was in the early 2000s from their album released called the state which was also a mainstream success .
well the roots of american football can be traced back to rugby
both games have a lot of similarities , basically running or kicking a ball over a goal line but you are right , the forward pass is unique
true . playing defense and offense in football have special positions on each so in that regard there are tons of substitution ##s
i think a big difference is the play after a tackle . in football , the play stops completely and the offense retains the ball . in rugby the play just goes on after a tackle , usually with a ru ##ck .

that ' s true . but , think about a lo ##bot ##omy ! due to all the dangerous serious side effects , that would be dan ##g scary to me !

i do like green but pink is my favorite . do you like the emerald which is obviously green in color ?
i read that in the middle ages green was the color associated with merchants , bankers , and gentry while red was for nobility
dogs in general are so cute , it is crazy to me that they evolved from extant gray wolves , as wolves are so much different , it is hard to believe they are ancestors
yeah , while the origins of dogs are not really clear , it is clear humans had a role in that process , which ama ##zes me , as we have created so many different and varying breeds of dogs
and on the flip side , people used to hunt wolves , such as gray wolves , which seems a lot more dangerous to me !
it ' s not just for rec ##ree ##ation , it is also done for competition and for transporting activities .
the word comes from old norse word ski ##o and mean split wood or fire ##wood .

they attempt to take the ball to the touchdown but running or throwing it .
similar to a soccer team , 11 players . they have to go at ##lea ##st ten yards from where the ball starts to get a first down .
it starts usually in the fall . it ' s an interesting game because while they have to play as a unit , each player has a different task .
while the offense attempts to score touchdowns , the defense is in charge of stopping them . through tack ##ling , intercept ##ing passes , etc .
the largest contributor to green in nature is ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l .

well he was a tough guy but a dreamer he came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes in northeast asia !
well organized and leaving su ##cc ##es ##ors to con ##tin ##uo his asian invasion , like he did after his death he left og ##ede ##i khan to con ##tin ##uo !

well both rugby and football have their origin in a variety of types of football played in britain in the mid 1800s , english public school games were based on those games so i would say it started to form around 1850s is ##h and evolved until we got what we have today .
well the first match of american football was played november 1869 between two college teams under rules of the association of football , so i can say america has been pretty serious about football for a while but i am not sure about pro football starting here . can ##da has a professional football team as well .
i am not a sports fan i watch more es ##ports than actual sports . also super non ##ath ##let ##ic i can trip over a grape . an ##ways lo ##l , college football is played by student athletes from american universities and colleges but some people don ##t know military academies also join in as well !
i loved the actors in the movies although originally i was offended that j . k . row ##ling would only use british actors .

obviously , she overcame it as since 1997 the books and films have been very popular
she attracted a world wide audience
no and motivation is a what causes a person to want to repeat a behavior like going to work
well only that a motive is what makes me develop the inclination to work
they say the wanting behavior is tied to the reward ##ing stimulus and have ways to try to increase it
they think increasing do ##pa ##mine by injection ##s helps
i still prefer green . it ' s the color of nature . lots of animals have adapted to their green environments .
emerald green is by far my favorite green emerald , emerald ##s actually get their color of green by its ch ##rom ##ium content
since the middle ages green is the color of money . it ' s has always been associated with merchants and bankers .
i know like diamonds emerald ##s are graded using the four c ' s .

i also love corn dogs and pig in a blanket
i always eat hot dogs when i watch a baseball game .

yes , i also like green cause many creatures have adapted to their environments by turning green themselves .
i am not sure but i know it is common in plants .
what hue of green do you like the most ?
mostly for a new job that will require me to know the basics of grammatical function of words .
i will be a foreign language teacher in public school district in tokyo .

that ' s really cool . i know some people play it as a sport as well , i personally like it just in my free time .

well , he is going to have to make up his mind about what he wants to do because , it ' s wrong to play with your emotions like that .
indeed . he is definitely regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century . sure that ##s why we call him the king !
it will . h was a pi ##one ##r of rock ##abi ##lly , an up ##tem ##po , back ##beat - driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues . where would the music world be without his influence ?
i just love finding out about old music . especially from the 1950s . finding out about how rock and roll dominated popular music and spread around the world . what a time to be living ! !
i have a few things that help me , and the biggest way is positive thinking . it helps me act in a certain way , or at least want to do that thing .
there are other theories on motivation such as direction towards positive stimulus or away from negative stimulus .
behavior therapy helps a lot . it ' s a type of psycho ##therapy that uses techniques for behavior ##ism and cognitive psychology .
i am a firm believer in cb ##t , which is a cognitive - behavior therapy . the best version of it is dialect ##ical behavioral therapy .
blue is good too . there is so much green to love because of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l in nature .
yes this is true ! i also like that green is the color of ireland because i ' m irish .
ha yes i was just going to say that money is green and green is the color of merchants , bankers .

the mona lisa painting is green . the costume she wore was green
very interesting . the mona lisa was made by leonardo da vinci .
oh that ##s nice ! what town around the " new south " did you live ?
that ##s awesome ! did you get to meet sheriff woody pride ?
yeah its been running since 2010 . that ' s a pretty long time for a show .
it certainly depends on the type of bowling game you are playing . some varieties include target bowling , ten - pin , nine - pin and duck ##pin . i think the best advice is to keep your arm straight .
ten - pin is the most popular , and it is what you played on your bowling date . most bowling games descend from a european lawn game called ski ##ttle ##s though !
so i think it consists of throwing a baton at some pins and the max score is 50 . people still play it in the united kingdom and ireland , but i have never played it .
yeah , association football . sorry , i should have specified ! he ' s someone that started way back in 1994 . he had good form all the way throughout , and that led him to get an international call - up in 1998 , leading him to get signed for the serie a defending champions , juventus .
no . . in fact , he ' s a french association football coach now ! and he was - - in both 2003 and 2004 , he as the runner - up for fifa world player of the year , so that gives you an idea of his skill . also won two league titles and three fa cups . partly why i like him is i ' m part french , and he represented us well at the international level , and is our leading goalscorer , too .
i agree with you . . he was mentor ##ed by the great ars ##ene wen ##ger , who made him somewhat of a prolific striker ( which is someone whose primary mission is to score ) , and so that set him up to be able to be arsenal ' s all - time leading scorer with 228 goals in all the competitions he played in .
while he was runner - up in some accolades , he did get awarded p ##fa players ' player of the year twice , and the f ##wa footballer of the year three times . so , he was respected by his peers . always a good sign . guess that ' s why he made a natural transition to coach .
it ' s a means of transport , a recreational activity and a competitive sport in the winter
me too the word ski is norwegian
cross country skiing is a popular sport and activity . some use it as a transportation means .
skiing began in australia in kia ##ndra , new south wales in 1861 .
it ' s also the color of the mineral emerald , due to the ch ##rom ##ium .
me too ! it ' s such a lovely shade . i also love the color green found in nature .
the plants are that color due to the chemical they use during photos ##yn ##thesis called ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l . i think green is a very lucky color .
absolutely ! plants need the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l in order to absorb energy from light , or they will die .
the offense takes the ball and tries to run it across the field to the other goal / side
well in american football the opposing sports teams try to get the ball from each other and tackle other players
american football can be a dna ##ger ##ous sport and has lead to issues with concussion ##s and such
yes it is , the nfl and the superb ##ow ##l is huge with american football in the united states

on a quick side note , it was coco chan ##el who is credited with popular ##izing card ##igan ##s for women .
i like how you can use many devices such as computers , laptop ##s , tablet s and smartphone ##s
i love using my phone to order things online like clothes and such !

oh well , to find out you just have to finish reading from where you left off . . ha ##ha ##ha . vol ##de ##mo ##rt overthrow the wizard governing body known as the ministry of magic , and sub ##ju ##gate all wizards and mug ##gles , a reference term that means non - magical people
i know athletes use a number of con ##co ##ctions and tonic ##s to boost performance

body ##bu ##idi ##ng supplements really becca ##me popular in the 1970 ' s and 1980 ' s
that ##s awesome , nirvana has kind of had an influence on the entire music industry since they released their first album " b ##lea ##ch " .
nah im a early 20s college student but nirvana has still had a pretty large lasting impact on the industry . ever since co ##bain committed suicide via shotgun though it came crumbling down sadly .
ye ##a i think him using a shotgun to commit suicide made it a bit more gr ##ues ##ome so it had a bit more shock impact but too many talented musicians lost to suicide without getting help sadly .
better to get help than to just end it all , the pain they had to go through without getting help from those around them while the public breathe ##s down your neck at the slightest thing is pretty messed up .
well its mostly a heavy feeling but in some rare cases it can cause physical damage to the heart .
only in rare cases , some think the " pain " of a broken heart is believed to be part of the survival instinct .
its unique to each person but the concept is believed to be universal . so we all know what it feels like .
well the neurological process involved in the perception of heart ##ache is not known . but in some cases people have experienced it .
yeah , in other words , when nirvana was formed ?
in what year nirvana was created , do you know it ?
well , i have heard , it was formed in 1987 , it that true ?
i mean it ranges from chanting slogan ##s to intense physical activity , it sounds like it could be to me .
yeah there are a lot of competitive routines , they often last one to three minutes .
there are an estimated 1 . 5 million participants in all - star cheerleading but i don ' t have any information on whether or not they make money .
have you done free ##riding ? it ' s similar to mountain biking , but you mostly go downhill and work on jumping and tricks and such .
have you been to british columbia ? biking is really popular there .
the pacific northwest is such a nice place to visit . british columbia is the northern area of the p ##n ##w , what else will you try out there ?
you should check out the columbia river , it goes into british columbia ' s rocky mountains .

so you can say that you are in one of the most ancient ##s jobs ! accounting can be traced to ancient civilizations !
that is true ! and i can imagine you must be very careful ##l in your job , with taxes that are imposed on income by the federal government , can you get into trouble by making a mistake ?
that is quite a res ##pon ##sa ##bility for you and the companies that hire you , i know that generally tax is imposed on just the net profits , so it is not all of the profits , am i right ?
is it very difficult to learn as a second language ?
the pure vowel system of the japanese language fa ##sc ##inates me .

you can definitely hear the chinese influence in it if you listen .
of course it does , harry potter , the novel chronicle the life of a young wizard , harry potter , and his friends her ##mi ##one grange ##r and ron we ##as ##ley
thank you , they are all students at hog ##wart ##s school of witchcraft and wizard ##ry .

i actually am ! i own many myself . i am always fascinated by the fact plants green because of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l and photos ##yn ##thesis
yeah it ' s quite an impressive invention . looks like we are basically pseudo botanist ##s based on our enjoyment of plants .
its the practice of killing or trapping animals , or pursuing or tracking them

end ! it only spread into a bigger zombie apocalypse , a widespread rise of zombies hostile to human life engages in a general assault on civilization .

the raiders are my favorite team and the steelers are my girlfriends favorite .
yes . and the raiders have been playing since 1960 so that ' s a lot of games .
i think i ' d consider hunting if it was to do pest control . like if there were too many delicious rabbits terror ##izing the house .
they are cute . it ' s also interesting that the males are called bucks and the females does ! just like deer !
my grandfather used to hunt white - tailed deer in mexico ! he also went to canada for them as well .
i ' d like to travel , but maybe not to hunt ! i ' ll shoot things . . . with a camera ! bad pun , but you get the idea .
i think so . i ' m from a very green place with many different plants of many different shades of green .

well some evolutionary psychologists argue that psychology is all modular to the mind , to help make decisions faster ##s and avoid things easier because of bright colors .
yes , exactly . they even denied letting a 16 year old child live in the community in 1996 . i assume he was trying to live with his grandparents .

my grandmother has all those things done for her too . she always talks about the bingo games and talent shows they happen on a regular basis . it ' s nice to see and hear about her having fun .
i agree ! another important job is being in politics . hilary clinton is a great example .

i would say it is ore fish ##y , but it can also be processed to make cod liver oil which provides vita ##ins a , d and d along with omega - 3 - fatty acids which are really good for you !
another great thing you can try is fish and chips if you are ever in the united kingdom ! atlantic cod is the most common ingredient in fish and chips in the uk
that is too bad ! i love sea food , especially cod because its flavor is a lot more mild than most fish
i actually do know who that is and what he looks like ! he ' s a two - time olympic gold medalist !

he has probably done so ! i can ' t think of anyone off the top of my head . but i can tell you that chad k ##ro ##ega ##r has co - written several songs for other artists & films .
the only thing that confuse ##s me is that they are usually displayed in reverse chronological order , so recent posts appear first . after reading blogs for awhile , i finally got used to that concept .

she will have a blast . i remember going to competitions and doing our three minute routines . has she chosen a specialty ? i used to special ##ize in dance , but some of the girls were tumble ##rs , and jumps , and others were more cheer specialists .
i know she will do extremely well with that level of experience already . it will be great for her if it is a competitive team to travel and meet some of the 1 . 5 million other all - star cheer ##leader ##s !

well it has happened a couple times in my life . the pain wasn ' t so severe as to cause physical damage , as happens in " broken heart syndrome " .
yes , the heart can have trouble doing it ' s job of supplying blood , oxygen , and nutrients adequately - i guess it is from the depression and anxiety that often acc ##omp ##anies the state of mind .
i would imagine that it is possible , since it does does to the heart . but , the anxiety is probably the wo ##rt part of it , physical symptoms such as fast heart rate and sha ##kin ##ess .
the anxiety can leave a feeling of une ##asi ##ness and worry for the rest of a person ' s life . but , there is always hope if the person seeks out treatment .

yes , i ' m too slow to be a competitive skier ! i like to see it as a means of transport in which a participant uses ski ##s to glide on snow .
well long time ago , early skier ##s would use 1 long pole or spear instead of 2 like you see today .
well i ' m not sure if they do this anymore but the bottom of the ski ##s used to be covered with animal skin to aid the traction against the snow which helped improve speed .
there is actually a lot of events and most of them are recognized by the ioc ( international olympic committee ) and the fis ( international ski federation ) .
it sure is ! it was created by kevin sy ##strom and mike k ##rie ##ger .
yeah mostly , it ' s actually owned by facebook .
it was purchased in 2015 the same year that it allowed it ' s users to up ##load full size photos instead of only square .

like most sports what ever team has the most points at the end wins !
the first football game was played between college teams in 1869 so it has been popular a long time
american football originates from football and rugby
yeah ! ! lo ##l my favorite is probably the second one because i tend to get lost after that one , it gets so complicated with vol ##de ##mo ##rt and ron and her ##mi ##one that i still enjoy watching but tend to get confused about what ##s going on ! oh and ha ##gr ##id , i like him ha ##ha .
i read the first and second books lo ##l . maybe that ##s why i understand them more . the books have actually sold more then 500 million copies ! the best selling book series ever . !
i was young when i read them like maybe 10 or so . my parents were okay with it but i have heard that some parents became very concerned regarding the dark tone the later books included along with the graphic violence as well . i don ##t personally find them to be too bad though .
i think they started off that way but wound up attracting more of an adult audience as well . they are definitely symbolic milestone ##s of modern young adult books .
they formed in 1985 , from los angeles !
they actually first signed in 1986 to ge ##ffen records !
their debut album reached number one on the billboard , with their famous song of sweet child o ' mine !
i ' m not sure , but slash from the band has released three solo albums , one in 2014 .
its actually the first book to talk about the magic community in britain
the land oz written in 1900 does that too
id defiant ##ly say harry potter
i actually have a grandfather who practices bee ##keeping , he sells the honey from his colonies at the local fresh market !
it ' s actually very safe , his bee ##hi ##ves are all enclosed and actually bees are very smart , they would never sting their " keeper " because they know he ' s beneficial to them .
my gran ##fat ##her finds that sage helps them to remain calm . as long as no new bees are introduced , a honey bee colony is usually incredibly peaceful .
like dream theatre , shadow gallery , that sort of thing ?
i know a bit more about shadow gallery to be honest - the comic they took their name from ( v for ve ##nde ##tta ) is one of my absolute favourites
yes ! i loved the film adaptation too

yes , daniel radcliffe is a great actor . interesting how harry potter has attracted a wide adult audience and younger readers .
i know the harry potter series was criticized for the dark tone as the books progressed . even the films had some graphic or violent moments .
american football actually originated from rugby football .
yes ! and the first match was played in 1869 between 2 college teams .
yes , its been around for quite a while . since the mid 19th century in britain

j . k . row ##ling , she ' s real famous in america , although it ' s highly debated whether there are occult or religious con ##not ##ations to her works
the first one released in june of 1997 , seems like it was yesterday , that ' s so crazy . they were the talk of recess at my school as a child . every kid wanted them for their birthday .
i ' ve seen a good number of them , but i am horrible with continuity so i never did finish them . do you like the beatles ? sir james paul mccartney is one of my idols .
you ' re not missing much , it ' s cl ##iche , but reading the books is the real journey . the beatles were a do no wrong english group . honestly their best songs to me are from their white album
i sure can ! dirty jobs premier ##s mike rowe who gets tangled in all sorts of jobs that are far from the type you ##d ever want ! messy , gross , disgusting etc . . .

well the show made a total of eight seasons , all up until september 12 , 2012 .
myth ##bus ##ters premiered its first episode on january 23 2003 , bust ##ing all sorts of fun myths through science !
i go at least a few times a month : ) all the times i ' ve been bowling though , i ' ve only got one " turkey " getting 3 strikes in a row .
i didn ' t hear it until i got one and it showed up on the screen lo ##l . i just try to knock down as many pins as i can ( of course : )
well there are professional and un ##pro ##fe ##ssion ##al leagues , but i just play it as a hobby . i ' m not good enough to be in a league .
i understand that . i do usually go with the same group of friends , but we don ' t have a consistent enough schedule to compete .
it ' s not hard to get . the offense , or the team controlling the ball , attempts to advance down the field by running with and passing the ball while the defense tries to stop them .
honestly , do we really need to know much other than whoever has the most points at the end wins ? you will get the yelling , boo ##ing and cursing because people get very involved .
i honestly don ' t think so , not to me . i more enjoy just getting together with people , watching the teams i like play , and re ##jo ##icing when they win .
well next time , just mention that american football has been around since 1869 , then you will seem know ##led ##ga ##ble !
yeah ! it ' s a recreational activity and a competitive winter sport for gliding on snow . have you ever been ?
well modern skiing evolved from beginnings in scandinavia , so winter originally . have you watched it on the olympics ?
yes ! yeah cross - country skiing was one of the first five sports in the winter olympics !
for sure and it is an excellent source of physical fitness .
sounds fun ! do the competitions factor into fitness culture also ?
that is very true . i love watching fitness and figure competitions of all types so this interests me a lot .
you ' ve probably heard a few songs off their debut album , appetite for destruction . their only number one song , sweet child o ' mine came from that album .
they ' formed in 1985 in california ! isn ' t that unbelievable ! ?
the original band ##mates were ax ##l rose on vocals , lead guitarist slash , bassist duff mc ##ka ##gan , rhythm guitarist izzy st ##rad ##lin and drummer steven adler .
i know they ' ve done at least four . the did appetite for destruction , g n ' r lies and use your illusion i and ii . all of their albums were huge successes !
in 2011 the population was 6 . 6 million
it was covered in thick woodlands during the middle ages
northern ireland is good , it ' s also part of england .
mine is green as well . mostly because i ' m of irish descent and it has a long historical tradition of being our color .
not recently . i have some pride as being an irish american , despite only having partial ancestry from ireland .
oh wow , that ' s surprising ! i was told by my grandfather that i may have some american indian too , but i ' m not sure about that .
it ' s funny how americans mix up " indian " and " native americans " ! that mis ##con ##ception still lives on .
that ##s a good color choice , i have one that was made in a machine , but i do prefer the hand - knit ##ted ones if i can find them .
yes i know some types of knit ##ted card ##igan ##s that has an open front can go for thousands of dollars , its crazy .
iv ##e had some luck with finding a few at the local goodwill but its a rare find indeed , it just seems people aren ##t hand knitting them anymore sadly .
you and me both , i have been snow ##boarding quite a few times . but i now think skiing may be a bit of a better fit .
that makes sense . not a lot of snow sports going on there ! you know , the first depiction of a skier with ski poles dates all the way back to 1741 ?
absolutely ! for a long time the skier would wear a long straight ski on one leg for sliding , and on the other would ear a short ski for kicking and gaining momentum .
it might be because its commonly associated with merchants and bankers !
no but it is part of the r ##gb color model .
it has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495 ##57 ##0 nm .
medical bills are not required by law to take any exams or anything like that .
they do not even have to know how to bill medical ##ly . they do not have to take the cm ##rs or r ##hia , they could just be making up how much stuff costs .
there is a certification school , a one week class . that is about it .
not really , before all billing was done on paper . now however , a lot is done electronically which has helped at least keep track of claims and records .
yes many shades of green are named after plants or trees . i have always loved the color gr ##ee ##e
also if you are interested in a science lesson . . lo ##l . . plants are green b / c of the chemical ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l
but what about the fact that ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is any of the several green pigment ##s that is found in cy ##ano ##ba ##cter ##ia and the ch ##lor ##op ##las ##ts of algae and plants ? that ' s something i just read . lo ##l
several minerals also have a green color . like an emerald which i really love !
exactly . that ' s why i just stick to watching competitive skiing occasionally .
not really , but it has been around for so long , or about five millennia .
i know , it ' s crazy ! it has evolved drastically since it was made in scandinavia .
yeah i really don ' t know if i could ever live there , it is ridiculous ##ly cold over in scandinavia . no wonder they used ski ##is .
do you like rodney mu ##llen ' s work at all ? he ' s like a pioneer of pro skate ##boarding .
a lot of people consider him the most influential skater because of how many tricks he has invented in his time .
yeah he invented the kick ##fl ##ip , it used to be called the magic flip but i guess that didn ' t sound cool enough lo ##l .
yeah some of my favorite tricks are freestyle tricks done from a stationary position , it ' s just so much harder to pull off .
yeah , he formed that band in 1987 as part of the seattle music scene which then became known as gr ##ung ##e
apparently they had a few songs that were a success as they were labeled the flagship band of generation x
what ' s kinda funny is that co ##bain didn ' t like it - thought his message and vision and been mis ##int ##er ##pre ##ted by the public . - go figure !
calling is the hardest thing to master . everything else is pretty easy . iv ##e been a few times . it can be really fun , and really frustrating at the same time
well honestly the snake or spider is probably more beneficial to the ecosystem then a duck honestly . the duck and geese populations are very well managed and controlled through hunting . there are a lot more benefits then not to hunting water ##fo ##wl .
hunting in general funds a lot of conservation programs . provides thousands of pounds of meat ##s to food banks and shelters . controls invasive species of some animals in different parts of the world . generates revenue for towns in popular hunting areas and the list goes on really .
duck is really dark meat , and can be greasy . all depends on how and who prepares it . iv ##e had some that taste great , and others not so much . but if it comes down to being hungry or not , id eat it every day .
well the original idea of the cross breed of this dog was to develop guide dogs suitable for visually impaired individuals with really bad all ##er ##gies so that makes them the perfect companion dog .
yep and the are also bred so that their coats don ##t shed like other dogs , which reduces pretty much all dan ##der that would make you s ##nee ##ze .
yep and if golden ##do ##odle ##s aren ##t your thing po ##odle ##s are also considered to be greatly h ##yp ##oa ##ller ##genic just like this breed .
yep and they come in all kinds of sizes like the famous standard sized po ##odle , miniature po ##odle and even a small toy po ##odle .
the population of ireland is about 6 . 6 million , the second most populous in europe .
i haven ' t but i heard they have lush vegetation due to it ' s climate which is free of extremes in temperature .
i recently found out there are twenty six extant mammal species native to ireland . i love animals so that was cool to me .
i ' m actually not sure , i just know the amount . i would love to visit ireland one day !
they are popular among adults and well as younger readers of modern young adult literature ,
that would be fun . the series had some criticism about the dark tone as well as some graphic violence it depicts .
i agree . they have sole over 500 million copies worldwide , making them the best selling series in history and they are written in 82 languages .
it was released on june 26th 1997 and has amazing acclaim and success
in 1910 a man named eugen sand ##ow is said to be the first modern western body builder and used dietary control to enhance muscle growth .
in october 199 ##e the dietary supplement the health and ed act came signed into practice .
body builder earle lied ##erman was in favor of beef extract or beef juice as a way to initiate muscle recovery .
i do consider them better that the movies , they were initially released on june 26th , 1997 to immense popularity .
i ' m not sure if she is or not , she is define ##tel ##y a millionaire though , the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide !
they have ! it is the best selling book series in history ! you should really give it a read .
yeah you need to buy them at least to have them on your shelf .
me too ! they were the nfl ' s first modern era expansion team .
i am not sure but there are multiple professional leagues in north america .
the nfl , afl and cfl .
cycling is the use of bicycles for transport , recreation , exercise
biker ##s and cyclists are people who engage in cycling
cycling " also includes the riding of un ##ic ##y ##cles , tri ##cycle ##s , quad ##rac ##y ##cles , rec ##umb ##en
cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation
i would say his greatest hit would be his last one , where he hit the ground when he died . i do know his career started back in 1954 .
elvis died young , sometime in the 1977 ##s
his fans was anyone that loved heartbreak , he actually had a single about it .
i think the title was heartbreak hotel . it came out in 1956 .
yeah , it ' s definitely weird to think that way . the balls usually have three holes and the heavier it is , the better .
i ' d agree , but there are such things as duck ##pin bowling where the balls are smaller , lighter , and without holes .
i hear its very popular in croatia and bosnia .
i think it ' s just the traditional design to have three finger holes . it also probably helps with grip .
how funny . i ' m a vegetarian , too ! people become vegetarian for health reasons , economic ones , preferences , cultural reasons and more . it is good that he eats the meat , to me that is different than people just doing it for fun .
it is the same with my husband . he ' s not a hunter but he eats meat , but he does that himself . the kids are vegetarian , too . we do a o ##vo - lac ##to vegetarian diet so we do have dairy and eggs but no meat .
yes , we have milk and cheese , too . i would also love to be vega ##n , but i know what i can manage . the kids do great with it . since i raised them vegetarian , they couldn ' t even imagine eating meat .
good for her ! in most developed countries , you don ' t need it for survival . there is so much food we can eat , even at restaurants .
yeah , the offense controls the football and attempts to advance the field by running or passing .
the offense has to advance ten yards in four plays , which are actually called downs . otherwise the other team gets the ball .
points are scored by advancing the ball to the opposing team ' s end zone for a touchdown or field goal .
there are lots of forms . i love ten - pin bowling .
there is five and nine pin also . those are more popular outside of the u . s .
interesting question . do you bowl yourself ?
on st . patrick ' s day i always wear green ! that holiday has been celebrated on the north american continent since the late 18th century
green is such a fun color ! the most green in nature comes from ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l , a chemical that allows plants to photos ##yn ##thes ##ize and convert sunlight into chemical energy .
hedges are green as w ##ll - they are usually used as wind ##break ##s to improve conditions for the adjacent crops
if hedges are clipped and maintained they are also a simple form of top ##iary .
i still like hot dogs even though hot dogs are made from car ##ib ##ou meat in alaska .
yes but some are still not all beef they add other ingredients especially the hot dogs that are in corn dogs just a fun fact .
that is good to know then because all beef is important it is a high source of protein which we need .
beef is also a main source for steak ##s like sir ##lon and rib eye etc .
jazz is just so soothing and that classical music sound mixed with blues makes a great fun night at the festivals . have you been to one before ?
do you go to jazz clubs they are like the festivals but better people be swing dancing and singing blues notes .
it is a style of dancing that was originated for jazz music the moment is very interesting and fun .
it ' an australian children musical team from 1998 ! what all do you do ?
its pretty much all the same : ) i love australian tv . especially play school .
a bit ! it was made by joy w ##hit ##by .
not sure but several minerals have a green color .
yes , the emerald , which is colored green due to its ch ##rom ##ium content .
green is very common in nature , especially in plants .
the largest contributor to green in nature is ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l .
it must have been fun chanting slogan ##s to intense physical activity .
did you ever do competitive cheer - leading ? the contain a lot of components like tumbling , dance , and stunt ##ing .
that ' s cool ! apparently cheerleading org ##ion ##ated in the us and has about 1 . 5 million participants .
there are also about 100 , 000 part ##ica ##nts around the world in place like canada , china , and europe .
the tradition of west african and european were shown on the music of cuba . it is very unique .
it was the richest and present regional music ##s from various parts of the world .
yes , the cuban missile crisis was also termed as the caribbean crisis .
in cuban missile crisis , the people started their day with cuban music . it will promote the cold war between them .
yu ##p , they are healthcare professionals in the pre - hospital environment .
exactly ! they also make autonomous decisions on the emergency care of these patients .
i agree , i ' m glad that the title of para ##med ##ic is protected in some countries .
well in some countries it is a protected title and accountable to a professional regulatory body .
well there are two main types , the atlantic cod and the pacific cod . i think you an guess where each type lives ? : )
well traditionally is can be cured in salt , which preserves the fish . have you ever eaten fresh cod ?
ha ##ha , i mean cooked fresh ! not raw , although i ' m sure some people do . when it ' s cooked or fired it has a delicious mild flavor and fl ##ak ##y flesh .
yeah , that makes sense , apparently psychologists have studies colors and their effects on human behavior .
yes , they seem harsh compared to blue .
for blue , some effects are ser ##enity , trust , and security . for green , some effects are health , hope , and nature .
a decent amount . you know it is owned by facebook ?
it was created in 2010 and only available on the iphone at first
i believe it was the iphone 4 in 2010
i have never used an android phone before
my parents are irish , we irish love the color so much we adopted it as our national color
it ' s amazing how st . patrick ' s day is know all over the world . good to know al ##ot of creatures use green too
if ch ##lor ##op ##hyl were to be a person , i would tell it thank you because it helps us get green for the plants
skiing has a history of almost five mill ##enia ! can you believe that ?
it is ! it ' s funny that early skier ##s used only one long pole or spear . not two poles
skiing events are recognized by the international olympic commit ##te and also the international ski federation
that ' s true ! i grew up in soviet union , our winters were really long and snowy
talking to your friends and family can help , it isn ' t good to bottle up emotions . maybe they can help you move on .
that ' s a good idea . developing coping skills can really help to reduce stress overall . you may learn a lot of helpful tools .
that ' s true . try not to blame yourself , it ' s easy to fall down that hole and end up in a depressed state of mind .
take care of yourself ! eating right and getting exercise is also key to improving your mood .
i am sure i have . i terrible at remembering names of songs and groups they go with . i see they were formed in 1985 in los angeles , california ?
yes , i think i have . i see it says they released 6 studio albums and sold more than 100 million records worldwide . that ##s great !
i believe i have heard of both of those actually . they are the 41st best selling artist of all time
most bands do it would seem . i saw that " sweet child of mine " was the bands only single to reach number one one the " billboard " hot 100
i only know his music , like heartbreak hotel which was his first # 1 hit
he did , with his producer sam philips at sun records they wanted to bring african american music to a wider audience
that was a song he remade , it was originally written and recorded by carl perkins in 1955
quite a lot but he gave each of them his own style of back ##beat - driven fusion of country and blues which began rock and roll
yes when it launched in 2010 it was exclusively for ios .
yes the apps popularity caused an android version to be released in 2012
users can add hash ##tag ##s to their posts to personal ##ize them .

i liked harry potter and the dealt ##hy hall ##ows i saw that one first before actually watching them in order what is your favorite ?

me to but for now i am into marvel ##s really heavy now do you watch any of the series on television or read the books ?
i would like to try it some day . it dates way back to 10 , 000 - 900 ##0 bc , it ' s definitely something much older than most modern day " sports " !
indeed it is . some of the oldest bows discovered appear to come from holm ##ega ##rd swamp in denmark .
oh i would imagine , as with many things in life , they evolve over time to become more efficient and / or user friendly .
same and increasingly , elements and principles of game design are also applied to other interactions
from what i heard game design creates goals , rules and challenges to define a board game
well academic ##ally , game design is part of game studies
yes they do , they can cheer for competition , for entertain an audience or just to motive sports teams !
oh no , i could handle chanting slogan ##s but there is no way i could perform any of the intense stunt activities they do . . i ' d break many bones ha
i bet they were neat to watch , dancing , jumping , tumbling and cheering around . how long did the competitions last ?
oh that isn ' t too long , it would be super exciting to see them live ! i need to go see some cheer ##leader ##s live since it originated in the united states !
i just learned recently that the stone is highly included meaning that it is not very strong at all . it breaks easily , apparently .
except diamonds that have the highest hardness . hard to shatter those ##s !
then i wonder why diamonds are used in a lot of industrial applications such as cutting tools ?
i bet it does . the largest contributor to green in nature is ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l , a chemical produced in plants .
yes and many animals have adapted to their green surroundings by taking a green hue as camouflage .
an interesting thing about them is their eyes are independently mobile . they can train each one on different objects .
a vast amount . they stock 7 , 000 candi ##es from all over the world
lauren wanted to merge pop culture and art with the candy culture . so it ' s a bit more modern sounding . there ' s always m & m ' s !

i hear the same
yes , motivation helps direct one ' s behavior and actions
well a motive helps prompt someone to act in a certain way
yes true , but disclosure is important when talking about the range of topics , especially among two individuals
it ' s used a lot in paintings and is one of the additive primary colors
ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is actually the largest ' green ' contribute ##r in nature !
yu ##p , and some creatures even use it as camouflage due to how common it is . that ' s pretty cool . i wish i could do that
not only that , but there are a lot of green - colored minerals too . you don ' t think about it as much , but they are there
wow you ' re quite a skilled bowler , you must have gotten many turkey ##s in your life time , also known as three consecutive strikes in a row .
i believe some people call four strikes in a row a " ham ##bone " . how odd .
well i know that past 3 strikes they sometimes just add the word bag ##ger to the number of strikes , so five strikes in a row is called a five - bag ##ger , i guess that ' s kind of weird .
that ' s nice ! apparently it ' s ev ##oked by light and has a dominant wavelength of about 495 ##57 ##0 nm ? pretty wild , right ?
yeah , i ' ve heard domestic dogs can only see in black and white . i don ' t have a dog however .
nice ! labrador ##s are super cute ! apparently they ' re pretty popular dogs in canada , the uk , and the us .
i had a lot of fun with it back then too . it is one of the major types of throwing sports today , which really didn ' t surprise me .
yeah exactly . the most common is pin bowling , which is where you throwing the ball to knock over pins .
yeah , all you do is throw the ball at some pins to knock them over so it ' s really easy to pick up even if you aren ' t good .
i used to be so terrible , out of the maximum score of 300 i would sometimes barely get 100 .
i actually lost 35 pounds last year . now at my ideal weight . i found i was really motivated when i kept track of the weight loss .
it took almost all year . i used my ##fi ##tness ##pal to log my cal ##ories every day and to keep track of my weight . i lost at a sensible rate .
i pretty much eliminated processed foods and focused on " whole " foods - - meat ##s , fruits , vegetables . i used whole ##30 as a guide , others like the ke ##to ##genic diet .
i think ke ##to ##genic is too hard to sustain . look at whole ##30 if you ' re interested . you only do it for 30 days as a " re - set " for your diet . the key is really good nutrition , and eliminating junk .
its really famous , it has a history of almost five millennia , i have tried it once and i didn ##t like it
modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in scandinavia , i have tried it there , but i like their beer and cheese more : d
yes , now ##day ##s its made from titanium and other modern elements , word " ski " is one of a handful of words norway has exported to the world
there is also skiing in finland that uses as ##ym ##metric ##al ski ##s , i don ##t know their benefit tho
no but i like trail riding too . i love going on different trails to try them out !
same here . i have used our local bus services where i live to try out new places since our buses have racks on the front .
i understand that . there are intercity bus services that travel from city to city like greyhound i have thought of looking into as well .
yeah they are and with greyhound it goes to over 380 ##0 places in north america . i think it seems like a cheap way to see the country .
i like that you can apply digital filters to your images . i think it makes the images look much more professional .

the real name for lavender is actually lava ##nd ##ula and is a species of the mint family ?
yeah that ' s three consecutive strikes . a ham ##bone is four consecutive strikes .
there ' s also a target variation of bowling , where you try to get the ball as close to a target as you can rather than knocking down pins
yeah ! the ground you play on is different , too . it ' s grass or gravel
it was about 6 . 6 million in 2011 . it was ranked the second most populous island in europe .
i really don ' t know with all those people . a bit under 4 , 8 million live in the republic of ireland alone . north ##er ireland has about 1 . 8 million .
it certainly is . it ' s a shame . such a beautiful country with lush vegetation .
no they don ' t . have you ever been to ireland ?
green is a relaxing color . color psychology says hue ##s can determine human behavior .
one example is that red and orange are tied to st ##im ##ula ##nts .

i think he grew up around a city called fourth chick ##asa ##w bluff , south of the confluence of the wolf and mississippi rivers .
you should check out a book called the firm , its a really good read , it blew my mind after i read it , it will have you on the edge of your seat !
im sorry to hear that . emotion pain if severe enough can cause actual physical damage to the heart
social attachment and the pain system encourage people to keep close contact with people when they lose relationships
i hope you get through it . many cultures experience the same things and describe it the same way and having the same feelings
i agree . the offense , which is the team controlling , has to charge into the opponents head first !
i prefer offense since the feeling when you get to the end zone for a touchdown is so good .
yes it is ! its even harder due to the football rules all the time which you have to follow .
you ' re right . princeton , under rules based on the association , is already considering adding more rules !
i like celebrating christmas and watching christmas movies , and listening to carol ##s .
oh me too ! interesting ##ly , when it is winter in the northern hemisphere , it is summer in the southern hemisphere !
its because of the equator and the north and south poles . the word winter comes from the european root " wen ##d " , which relates to water .
well it depends . different cultures define different dates as the start of winter . some people even use the definition based on strictly the weather and not the time .
you have to check them out ! their debut album , appetite for destruction was released in 1987 and it is epic .
they ' re considered to be an american hard rock band based out of los angeles , california . besides their rock stuff , they put out a bunch of great ballads !
their only number one hit was sweet child o ' mine but i think they were more well known for their song welcome to the jungle . i ' d start with those two songs !
yes ! it ' s a great song to work out to . i have it on my gym play ##list too ! i think lead singer ax ##l rose has an amazing voice .
exactly ! and green is so common in nature - many plants are green !
right ! it allows plants to absorb energy from light - and is essential in photos ##yn ##thesis
that ' s because it absorb ##s green portions of the spectrum rather poorly , but it reflects it , producing the green color of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l - containing tissues
there is pin bowling which you ' re probably familiar with . there is also target bowling , where the rolling surface could be grass or gravel !
in target bowling the aim is usually just to get the ball as close to a mark as possible . it would be pretty tough to roll accurately on gravel !
i prefer traditional pin bowling , though i sometimes mix it up with ten - pin , or maybe candle ##pin . there are so many variations of pin bowling !
ok , equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers .
buy and sell shares of stock , bonds
nest ##le and nova ##rti ##s are dom ##ici ##led in switzerland , so they may be considered as part of the swiss stock market , although their stock may also be traded on exchange . as american deposit ##ory receipts
that ' s why the creation of the new york stock exchange ( ny ##se ) in 1817 was such an important moment in history . the ny ##se has traded stocks since its very first day . contrary to what some may think , the ny ##se wasn ' t the first stock exchange in the united states . the philadelphia stock exchange holds that title .
very cool . archery can be traced back as early as 10 , 000 bc in the late pale ##oli ##thic where they were used to hunt .

yes actually , his book the " firm " , was adapted into a 1993 feature film of the same name , starring tom cruise !
yes he is i think , but after after the events of the film and novel he prefer spending time with his family .
" a time to kill , " is a great novel , i really recommend you read it .
there is the composite bow , a traditional bow of horn , wood and sin ##ew .
it does . nowadays archery os mostly a com ##pet ##ative sport / recreational activity
it is mainly a recreational act ##ici ##ty
not sure but the person who participates is known as a bowman .
i like it because it reminds me of the emerald and other minerals that are of green color . the green in them is because they have ch ##rom ##ium .
yes exactly , ch ##rom ##ium is a chemical element , it ' s symbol is cr , it ' s atomic number is 24 .
it ' s a metal that ' s steel ##y - grey , lust ##rous , , hard and brittle . it makes a great polish !
that is a good question , probably hundreds . there are several minerals that are green in color such as emerald ##s !
oh so many , but i forget , emerald ##s are the most common ones though . i bet you know that green has a long historical tradition as the color of ireland !
i sadly do not know either , i am merely an expert on green ! another piece of history on green is that back in the middle ages and renaissance , the color was associated with merchants , bankers and the gentry .
here ' s one a good one ! the largest contributor to green in nature is ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l in plants ! they photos ##yn ##thes ##ize and convert sunlight into chemical energy .
i have heard green has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495 ##57 ##0 nm
it was ! and it is created by a combination of yellow and blue , or yellow and cy ##an
in fact many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue !

yes , it is a model that describes personality traits .
i ' m not sure about all of them , but i do know that con ##sc ##ient ##ious is one of them .
i agree , especially since they work in emergency services .
the uk is an interesting place . it ' s culture developed heavily out of the fact that it was an isolated island nation .
the uk actually contains more than just britain , but also ireland as well . the largest city is probably london .
well in that case you would probably be looking for belfast , which is the largest city of northern ireland , and the second largest in all of ireland .
it ' s hard to believe ireland is the third large ##t island in europe .
i ' m unsure of its earliest origins , but the earliest popularized date of the shirt i ' m aware of is from the 1930s . i ' m sure it ' s been around for longer .
the card ##igan is a knit ##ted sweater , made of wool among other fabrics .
well you might be fascinated to know that brit ##isch officers had knit ##ted waist coasts . i ' m unsure about other sweater ##s though .
well i enjoy a lot of the green in nature which mostly comes from that ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l in plants .
that might be so , there are perceptions based on color that are not really obvious like how things taste .
people can even perceive colors differently because of things you might not expect like age and gender can even influence it .
ye ##a and popcorn kernel ##s strong hull contains the seed ' s hard , star ##chy end ##os ##per ##m with 14 - 20 % moisture , which turns to steam as the kernel is heated

yep , in mexico , remnants of popcorn have been found that date to around 350 ##00 b . c . !
the popping of the kernel ##s was achieved by hand on the stove ##to through the 19th century
it really is . although the scope of what you do can vary widely across the globe , the para ##pro ##fe ##ssion in the us just recently came around in the 1970s , which most people don ' t know .
it varies widely . but it ' s a role that finds itself closely related to other healthcare positions , especially ems roles , where you have a higher grade role , which is to say you ' ll be granted both more responsibility and autonomy .
we will see . i may be moving , so it could change things , as there are different models of care for ems providers given the area they ' re in , and those different models can influence the scope of practice they can do in an area .
it ' s definitely a noble profession , as we strive to transport patients with illnesses and injuries to prevent the patients from transporting themselves and causing further harm . we aim to give them the best acute medical care !
def ##inate ##ly ' appetite for destruction ' released 1987 . arguably their best . number one on the billboard 200 a year after its release .

he has a great support system . the concept of a broken heart dates all the way back about 3000 years ago .
talking with friends is always good . some scientists attribute the emotional " pain " to be a sort of survival instinct .

the new drummer was always w ##hine ##y . after signing with major label d ##gc records , nirvana found breakthrough success with " smells like teen spirit "

cheer ##leader ##s cheer for their team to root for them .
competitive routines can be from one to three minutes .
cheerleading was founded in the united states .
in 1997 espn broadcast a global cheerleading competition .
oh that is very serious . good she is okay . routines don ' t last long , but they incorporate dance , tumbling and such .
yes that is correct . cheerleading began so long ago but males wanted no part in it then .
glad that males felt that they could be included later on . it ' s nice to have people cheering for you when you do a sport to give you encouragement .
yes he is attorney , author , activist and politician !

your correct . the last sunset was in october and the sun did not come back until march . different cultures define different dates as the start of winter but we called the last sun ##down winter .
winter is associated with snow and freezing rain here i ' m guessing it ' s not the same in texas ?
i lived up north for a while and it snow ##s all year . " winter " comes from the proto - indo - european root " wen ##d , " but we call say it came from the native people up here .
my mom ' s native american she has stores for each season . i ' ve been thinking about following winter and going from the northern hemisphere , to the southern to follow winter . am i crazy ?

yes , by the end of khan ' s life , the mongol empire stretched across central asia and china .

i have not heard of that myth . i would not place much stock in it as meteor ##s are rocks which would not make an ideal sword . khan is buried in an unmarked grave somewhere .
i am very disappointed but our offense did really well advancing down the field , our running and passing game wasn ' t too bad .
i am not sure he was born in 1997 so i don ' t think he has a lot in him maybe .
ha ##ha yes i typed the wrong number . he is almost as old as the seattle seahawks since they were formed in 1976
no that you know you will not be able to sleep . american football nfl starts this weekend . college is still a month away .
32 total . i ' m a bigger college football fan . it ' s hard to believe it evolved from rugby football .
depends on who you ask . teams have been playing since november 6 , 1869 and not all the teams are still around . i personally love the detroit lions and university of michigan football .

because there are not as many schools that offer this degree , the kids usually are competing for spots .
usually students begin to think about their entry plan starting in the 11th grade , so it can get pretty competitive .
they are usually in a drama club by that time so they can improve their chances . it is likely they will have to go through a two step process .
i guess the owner facebook , need the ad revenue to keep it going so i guess its ok
i don ' t know but i know the creator kevin sy ##strom and mike k ##rie ##ger did a good job and nothing much have changed since 2010 when it was launched . i believe its time for facebook to modify ins ##tagram

i don ' t know , but the first official college football team was not formal ##ized until 1879 .

for one , financial accounting focuses on the reporting of a company ' s financial information . this can be passed on to investors , regulators , and suppliers .
a long way back , in various forms . it was popular in the 1600 ##s in britain
i think it thrive ##s most in the usa , where it is played all over the country

you are welcome , the maximum score you can get is 300 - - i hope you make that score next time you bowl !

they have released 6 albums which have grossed over 100 million dollars in sales worldwide .
i don ' t think so but they are the 41st best selling group of all time .
nope , but had i lived in los angeles where they formed , i might have had a shot
i do enjoy it . ins ##tagram allows people to up ##load pictures and videos and get views and likes . some people are even famous because of it .
that ' s fair . some people are hesitant to use multiple platforms because they ' re concerned about the use of their personal , private information by facebook .
it ' s different from facebook in that it ' s media - focused , so the focus is on pictures and videos . some people prefer this over the text - focus of facebook .
kurt co ##bain was an american songwriter , singer , and musician , most famous for being in the band nirvana .

yeah , that is not surprising . the competitions get extremely competitive and the talent level is very high with about 1 . 5 million participants in the sport .
yeah the popularity has really exploded thanks to espn airing the national championships then it was further increased by the movie bring it on .
it is . the other cool thing for your sister is she might have opportunity to compete over seas . the exposure from those things has made it popular all over the globe from china to new zealand and a bunch of other places .
yeah ! it was cool to hear that their twin albums " use your illusion i " and " use your illusion ii " ( 1991 ) debuted at number two and number one on the " billboard " 200 respectively and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide , including 14 million units in the united states .

you are right i forgot that tropical zones don ' t experience winter at all .
i agree , in the arctic for instance , they have short summers so i know they always want more . my ac is out so i know i will enjoy winter .
climate in the arctic has a lot of variability so i can ' t say or sure , but i don ' t think they have ever went without a summer . even if that summer was just a few days .
i ' m about the same , snow ##ball fights and going ice skating with friends are some of my fond ##est memories .
i tend to change my favourite colours . gen ##dar , age and culture are a big influence on how people perceive colours .
pink got the name from the flowers pink ##s . i ' m not a big fan of flowers maybe that ##s why i am not a big fan of the colour itself . they are plants in the genus " dia ##nt ##hus "
they are flowering plants in the genus " dia ##nt ##hus " and the name comes from the fr ##ille ##d outside of them .
i haven ' t seen one but " na ##rc ##iss ##us " are pretty nice . they have six pet ##al - like te ##pal ##s .

the number varies , but there are over 156 national level federation ##s dedicated to the sport .
i try to adapt to the va ##gar ##ies of the weather . is caused by the axis of the earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the sun .
more so , many regions , winter is associated with snow and freezing temperatures .
arctic is characterized by long , cold winters and short , cool summers . are you located along the arctic ?
no i ' m not good at anything . i like bowling video games . i have never gotten a 300 which is 12 strikes in a row !
usually xbox but i have found the game on my phone . i never heard of the word ham ##bone to describe four strikes in a row though .
well the object is to knock over the pins and i ' m not very good unless we have some bumper ##s , ha !
not good at any sports , not quite sure what i ' m good at . maybe i could take up bowling as a hobby , like most people in the world .
facebook actually owns ins ##tagram , so i don ' t know why it wouldn ' t be a bit more similar in that area .
i believe ins ##tagram is more about just up ##loading photos and videos , that ' s about it .
i agree ! ins ##tagram lets the users implement digital filters to their images and also lets them put on their location by using geo ##tag ##s . that is all about appearances !
no , it ' s easy . that ' s why i like it . it ' s almost like an arcade game
do you like music ? video games have great music
ha ##ha . cool . have you ever heard of " i like music " ?
i think it ' s like spot ##ify for alternative music
well , technically , it can also be a means of pest control . so it ' s not just about gaming . do you have a pest issue in your area ?
yes , some animals can become a burden for those practicing agriculture . so , the laws can change to allow hunters to control the animal population , whether by chemical or cultural needs .
sometimes , animal rights advocates oppose the hunting due to moral objections , but practical demands tend to over ##ride their arguments .
i bet . it really got popular around 2000 when the movie " bring it on " was released .
yeah , it really helped to explode it into the lime ##light . there ' s over 1 . 5 million people completing in all - star cheerleading !
it is pre ##dom ##inate ##ly female , but it actually began during the late 18th century with a rebellion of male students .
yes , i try to only set live traps i don ##t want anything to suffer
yes , i love them just like augustine cha ##con did
mexican outlaw and folk hero of arizona territory that had a pet fox
that sounds great ! is it like street food ? can you buy it from stalls or at the market ?
i love fish markets ! so busy and vibrant . i ' ve always wanted to go to pike place fish market in seattle - have you ever been ?

you should know that in the middle ages and renaissance , green was associated with merchants and bankers ! i bet your girlfriend might be impressed by that !
also , it is the traditional color of ireland and of gaelic culture ! if you like ireland , then you have to like green as well !
many animals take on the green hue themselves as camouflage ! i wish humans could do that . .
yeah ha ##ha so it ' s basically a sweater , but it has an open front . . . like a jacket without a zipper .
yeah ! it ' s for the fresh kind of weather , where you can ' t be without a sweater because it ' s too cold nor can you be with a jacket because then it gets too hot . you know ?
yeah ! card ##igan ##s actually became really popular for college students during the early 1930s so yeah , style and color are critical , too ha ##ha
i ' m honestly not too sure , but they can ' t be that price ##y ! maybe $ 10 , tops ?
yes i like the main character the sheriff deputy rick
yes , they are making more episodes . andrew lincoln plays the shows sheriff
i actually do not know that answer , i know the show shows al ##ot of survival and adapting of the new world with walkers and other survivors .
i like that rick is such a natural leader
i am a mountain biker . i enjoy riding over rough terrain and up and down mountains . have you heard of this sport ?
no , i ride on the ali ##for ##nia trail , which was established in the 1800s . the trail runs from missouri to california .
i did it all in one summer . my next ride will be on the oregon trail , which was a route fur traders used around 1820 . it used to only be pass ##able on foot or horseback , but i have a good mountain bike .
sometimes when i am riding in a lonely area , i like to sing the song " daddy wouldn ’ t buy me a bow wow " , which was written in 1892 .
hot dogs are very classic sausage and bun food you get at sports games and stuff

yep , mustard and sa ##uer ##kra ##ut are my favorite o ##ve r ##like re ##lish and ke ##tch ##up
yes its great , andrew lincoln plays the main character he is such a good actor
not sure , but i know it takes place in atlanta go ##rg ##ia and later virginia
in america , together the characters struggle to survive the harsh zombie conditions
in america as well , it has such good ratings it is getting renewal ##s every year
i love dead ##liest catch . never thought i would , given the subject matter , but i do .
cannot believe that dead ##liest catch started in 2005 and it is still on and airs in over 200 countries .
i think mike rowe , the narrator , does a fantastic job and i like the crews .
yes , very popular . it all started with college football though .
walter camp created a hybrid of rugby that became american football .
eleven per team .
that ##s funny ! i just don ' t like the fact that you have to advance the ball 10 yards in four downs , or they turn over the ball , its so confusing
i also find it confusing that in canada there is a canadian football leg ##ue and and american football , using the same terms in football
especially since american football started in 1869 in college but euro ##po ##ean f ##ott ##ball has been around for much longer
at least one thing the same is that the team with the most points in the end wins the game
ha ##ha , i like blue and yellow because they ' re the colors of the swedish flag !
ha ##ha , i beg to differ . once the ice melt ##s away from winter , sweden is all green ! it ' s green because of all the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l in nature .
you are funny . okay , but green is also a big part of irish culture , since sweden will not do for now .
because green is between blue and yellow when viewed with a spectrum ##s .
yes ! because its the largest contributor to green in nature is ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l
do you know of photos ##yn ##thesis in biology ?
that ' s a natural process , how about the artificial photos ##yn ##thesis ?
he lives outside oxford , mississippi . his books have been translated into 42 languages .
i would have to say " the firm " . they actually made a movie about it starring tom cruise . john gr ##isha ##m graduated from mississippi state university
agree , most movies are a poor rendition of the book . he also attended the university of mississippi school of law in 1981 .
well i think college football is the best . even though it ' s considered second - tier . do you watch it on tv ?
oh i have no clue , but within the us the college version of football ##s garner ##s high tv ratings
oh i ' d say at least 30 , ha ##ha . the history of the game can be traced to early versions of rugby if that tells you anything
oh well one ' s the uk version and the other evolved in the united states
the first football game was played on november 6 , 1869 .
the teams were rutgers and princeton . two college teams .
well american football evolved from rugby , so i am guessing that ' s how they played .
i ' m not sure , but there are multiple leagues in north america . the most known are the nfl , afl , and cfl .
skiing , believe it or not , was originated in norway and the word ski is pretty common in their language , also had different meaning .
i think skiing was originally a purely ut ##ili ##tarian activity , and it was first started in the mid - 1800 ' s as a recreational sport .
basically what you said . many forms of skiing is where skier ##s rely on their own loco ##mot ##ion to move across snow - covered terrain , instead of using ski lifts and other forms of assistance .
i get so nervous watching skier ##s ha ##ha . i like how the olympics has different variants of skiing that is adapted to different range of terrain ##s from mountainous tops to groom ##ed courses . definitely a interesting but dangerous sport to watch !
they are so fluffy and cute right ? ! the original purpose of the cross was actually to develop guide dogs suitable for those with all ##er ##gies to dogs !
yes , it has . their coats do not shed , so it reduces all ##er ##gies in humans .
i wouldn ' t say completely safe , but the fact that their coats do not shed reduces dan ##der , which is a protein that sheds from the dog ' s skin and this is what will cause all ##er ##gies to humans .
they were founded in detroit and are known as horror ##core rap .
horror ##core is what they call a sub ##gen ##re of hip hop . it usually has a horror them and dark lyrical content .
yes ! they often ex ##agger ##ate violence and the supernatural . sometimes drug use and mental illness as well .
well i agree . mental disorders are nothing to joke about . they can cause significant distress and other problems .
yes , co ##bain was the lead singer and guitarist and the founding member of nirvana
on april 8th he took his life , at his home in 1994 . very gr ##ues ##ome death , he was found with a shotgun across his body .
i am sure he had just checked out of rehab and was reported as suicidal by his wife courtney love .
i mean he was a pioneer of up ##tem ##po rock ##abi ##lly music . it don ' t get much better than that .
my favorite was his first single called " heartbreak hotel " .
that was a great song . you have to admire him for taking african american music global .
he became even more popular with the ladies when he got into acting .
the offense scores it , by either running or passing the ball , and they have four chances to advance it 10 yards , or they lose control . the points come mostly by moving the ball into the other team ' s end - zone , or kicking the ball through the opponent ' s goal ##post ##s !
essentially , yes ! there are those who block for the quarterback , who throws the ball to the wide receivers to catch it , or he can give it to the running back to carry it . and the defense has both those to rush the quarterback and to guard the receivers . interesting ##ly , this all started from evolving from rugby football !
no , they share this style with canada , as well , who have their own professional league . although there are some slight differences between the two .
i do it because i live out in the middle of nowhere , so i need food . others might do it just for fun , or to trade .
yeah , indians also used to hunt for food , and trade .
i agree , but so much excessive hunting has also led to the extinction of many animals .
it can be beneficial when there are areas there are over ##pop ##ulated , and you need to control the pest ##s .
cool i didn ' t know that ! they were actually popularized by coco chan ##el who disliked for tight - neck ##ed men ##s sweater ##s messed up her hair when removed .
one good thing about synthetic fibers is that they are not made from animals , mostly derived from fibers .
yes i agree natural fibers are usually more comfortable . some are actually made through geological processes .
they measure process and communicate financial information about economic entities like business and corporations . a good field for people who love math
well you can use the phrase financial reporter as accountant synonymous ##ly and you can get away with it !

weight training develops your muscles .

well i can definitely tell you para ##med ##ics have to know tons of knowledge and have skills to take care of patients while transporting them .
i can only imagine i am sure having someone ' s life in your hands could be very intense , para ##med ##ics typically work 12 hour shifts or split into four 10 hour shifts . so make sure to get rest !
just make sure you are getting plenty of sleep during the day , to much stress and little sleep can cause memory loss , and make it harder to pass those classes .
one thing you can do to help is make sure you are on a diet plan , making sure you are getting the right nutrition will keep you up to speed !
that ' s okay ! it ' s a physical activity past ##ime that started in the united states , where cheer ##leader ##s perform dances and chant slogan ##s to mo ##tiv ##ate and entertain sports audiences .
that ' s a really great question . it ' s mostly popular in american football , starting in 1954 when the baltimore colts national football league ( nfl ) team decided to have cheer ##leader ##s . now , 26 of the 32 nfl teams have a cheerleading squad !
totally agree . most cheerleading gigs in the nfl are part - time jobs . very often , cheer ##leader ##s are in or just completed college , and continue onto other careers after one to four seasons of cheerleading on average .
accounting has been around since 149 ##4 ! an italian mathematician established it
i have thought about looking into becoming an accountant , someone that practices accounting
financial reporting and accounting are terms that can be interchange ##able and have the same meaning

i know they premiered in january 2003 , i don ' t think they are running new episodes at this time but they always have re - runs on ! naked and afraid is also awesome , have you heard of it ?
yeah , i think card ##igan ##s that don ' t have buttons would be considered robes .
there are some versions that just hang open by design i think .
i believe it is a welsh name ce ##red ##ig ##ion , but an ang ##lic ##ised version
it ' s been going on for a long time . one of the earliest proposals at the federal level was in 1854 .
it was a bill for the ind ##igen ##t insane - established asylum ##s for the ind ##igen ##t as well as blind and deaf .
passed both houses , but veto ##ed by the president
president pierce - ever heard of him ?
well , in different cultures they define it differently as far as the start goes . some also define it based on the weather .
yes , although it ' s caused by the axis of the earth in that hemisphere since it ' s oriented away from the sun .
yes , although as i said they define it sometimes based on weather . interesting ##ly enough , in the south ##er hemisphere it ' s summer when it ' s winter in the north .
right ! the moment of winter sol ##stic ##e is when the sun ' s elevation with respect to the poles is at its lowest value , or far ##thest below the horizon .
it is ev ##oked by light
it is used in painting and color printing
the largest contributor to green in nature is ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l
that is true . it covert ##s sunlight into chemical energy in plants
they claim to be the largest unique candy store in the world , which was inspired by ro ##ald dahl ' s story of the willy won ##ka chocolate factory .
they have shops in new york city , los angeles , chicago and ma ##mi . the owner is dylan lauren , daughter of the famous designer ralph lauren .
i ' m sure it helps to have connections - dylan ' s candy bar also partnered with holt ren ##fr ##ew before in canada on a co - branding effort . i ' m sure holt ren ##fr ##ew paid some respects to her father as well .
holt ren ##fr ##ew is a chain of high - end canadian department stores that sell an array of luxury brands .
no idea . irish was lower - class back in the day , just ireland , a single sovereign state is how we regarded it .
could be . had something to do with the great potato famine which caused the immigration which resulted in 33 million americans reporting irish ancestry in 2013 .
reportedly about one million people died .
i ' m sure it began long long time ago because as far as i know people were always hunting to kill or trap animals
it is , but that ' s why there are laws . lawful hunting is distinguished from po ##achi ##ng which is the illegal killing or trapping animals
yes ! that ' s why you can hunt deer only during certain time of the year .
people can use traps for trapping animals , guns and bows and arrows for killing them
do you remember what his first novel was ? here is a hint : it was published in 1989 .
no , it was " a time to kill " . it took him 4 years to write .
yes that ' s right , " a time to kill " was a great movie .
" the firm " actually . it was about attorney mitchell mc ##dee ##re .
after he named himself gen ##ghi ##s , he proceeded to capture most of u ##eras ##ia
exactly this was often achieved by large scale massacre
by the end of his life he occupied most of central asia and china
if i ' ve been around for 5000 years that means i ' d be some sort of vampire , which may or may not be cool . but skiing actually evolved in scandinavia but has ancient roots in china .
that ' s a good question . perhaps he is old enough to remember when the original word for ski which was " ski ##ð " or " split wood " was invented .
actually he would only say " one ski , ah ah ah " because original early skier ##s used one long pole .
yes in alberta canada they formed the band in 1995
nickel ##back sold 50 million albums making them one of canada ##s most successful bands
not sure the last album they put out was silver side up in 2001
not exactly , but i know everyone loved him and called him the king or rock and roll
presley ##s first single was " heartbreak hotel " in 1956 !
i guess the songs were pretty good to be considered the king of rock and roll , like how michael jackson was the king of pop
they can also include securities listed on a public stock exchange as well as those only traded privately
some examples include shares of private companies which are st ##old to investors through equity crowd ##fu ##nding platforms
yes i have a few . . as of mid 2017 , the size of the world stock mark ##ey was about us $ 76 . 3 trillion !
well you can pro ##ba ##by look online and do some research however stock exchanges list shares of common equity as well as other security types like corporate bonds and convert ##iable bonds
his books have been translated into 42 languages and have been published all over the world .
yeah he is . he graduated from mississippi state university before attending law school in 1981 .
he practiced criminal law for about 10 years and was a congressman from 1984 to 1990 .
his first novel " a time to kill " was published in june 1989 . it took him four years to write it .
first and foremost , green is the color between blue and yellow on the color scale .
secondly , when we look at nature , most things you will see are green . the reason for that is because many creatures have adapted to their green environment for cam ##ou ##fl ##aging .
i suppose it ' s due to the trees and plants taking on the color green . speaking of which , the reason why plants are green is due to ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l , the chemical in which plants photos ##yn ##thes ##ize and make food when in contact with light .
that is true ! speaking of green , it also has a long tradition in popular culture . st . patrick day ' s is an irish tradition that basically has everyone dressed in green .
well it has been around almost forever . the name comes from the latin word " arc ##us " .
it means archer i think . today it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity .
it is and a person who participates in archery is typically called an archer or a " bowman "
i suppose the natural greene ##ry and trees brought in from outside contributed to it .
well , it ' s the color of money ! seriously , though , in the middle ages and renaissance , merchants and bankers were associated with green and nobility was associated with red .
i ' m not sure why , but ireland seems to love the color green , too !
i wonder who figured out that they could combine only certain colors ( like red , green , and blue - r ##gb ) to create all other colors ? it is hard for me to understand .
yes rush ! they formed in 1968 and took their first united states tour in 1974 .
yes , he left because he had health problems related to type 1 diabetes .
clock ##work angels the 20th and final album they put out . it was released in 2012 .
it reminds me of spring and renewal . i love it when everything first turns green after a long winter .
its between spring and fall . i do love the fall colors too .
i love the autumn leaves and the way they smell . i love all the colors , yellow , brown .
i love halloween , and i love having bon fires and watching movies outside . one of my favorites is autumn leaves .
it ' s really good . the whole series is streaming . it ' s based on a comic book by robert kirk ##man .
it ' s streaming on netflix . most of it is also filmed in atlanta georgia and alexandria virginia .
starting on the 3rd season , the ages of most of the viewers were 18 to 49 .
yes , august 16th , 1977 was a very sad day for many people , especially his fans .
he was born on january 8 , 1935 . long time ago ha ##ha
he will never be forgotten as the king of rock and roll , or just the king
dylan ' s candy bar was actually founded by dylan lauren , the daughter of designer ralph lauren .
i ' m sure it does . she based the store off the story , " willy won ##ka and the chocolate factory . "
it really is a fun experience . i would definitely recommend going if you ' re ever in new york .
not , in the sub ##tra ##ctive color system . but in the r ##gb system used for television it is used .
in nature yes , it is because ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is green and there is a lot of plants and vegetation on earth .
it depends on fashion , in the middle ##s ages green was associated with people working with money like merchants , bankers and the gentry in general .
no it is not , but i like the fact the mona lisa is wearing green , it means that she is of a merchant or banker family .
same here ! lots of animals and insects and other creatures have adapted to the green in their environments by taking on green hue ##s themselves as a means of cam ##of ##lage
that ' s right ! the reason it ' s so green is because of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l . ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is the chemical which plants use to photos ##yn ##thes ##ize and convert sunlight into energy .
i don ' t know ! for whatever reason it reflects light that has the dominant wavelength of roughly 495 ##57 ##0 nm , so it looks green .
do you prefer an irish coffee made with brown sugar or white sugar ?
i prefer white sugar . the brown sugar makes it too sweet .
when i have a sweet tooth i reach for a dough ##nut . i love the fried dough with the g ##laze .
i once lived in the philippines . dough ##nut ##s were surprisingly popular there !
modern skiing is traced back to scandinavia . however , there is evidence it was practiced in china many years before that
they are long and narrow strips that allow for gliding over snow
i believe that china used something more like a snow ##sho ##e . it had a hardwood frame and lac ##ings
the word ski actually comes from ski ##o which is split piece of wood
only in the winter of course ! i love the various sweater designs - especially the ugly christmas sweater
that is awesome ! the salvation army is a great charity organization
that is great ! and buy doing so you are helping the salvation army in 128 countries , with homeless shelters and humanitarian aid
i have only shop ##ped there for halloween costumes but nothing else . i rarely buy new clothes .
how do you cope with dead lines . as i know you often do not not do your things until the " last minute " before a deadline .
in other words . pressure act like your motivation that prompt ##s you to act in a certain way , or at least develop an inclination for specific behavior .
that makes it some kind of motivation then because it has become your direction to behavior and what causes you to want to repeat the behavior .
we can say your motivation is classified on a number of bases :
what a grand idea to write about a young wizard , and such interesting names like her ##min ##one , we ##as ##ley and potter .
yes , a wonder chronicle and hog ##wart ##s fits a w ##hit ##ch ##craft and wizard school .
yes good movies , yet they have had their share of criticisms .
i can not believe over 500 million copies in seventy - three languages have been sold all over the world , that is success .
i think it ' s a fair number as they are mostly to mo ##tiv ##ate sports teams and entertain the audience . i assume there are so many teams to cheer for !
probably so because there are organisations to train and host cheer ##leader competitions . the main one is varsity spirit corp .
yes ! the origins of varsity spirit date back to 1948 !
he wrote legal thriller ##s . he was also an attorney and politician .
his first , " a time to kill " is older , it was published in 1989 but he spent four years writing it and in my opinion , it ' s his best .
yes , another book i like is to kill a mocking ##bird but that was written by harper lee . that is also about a crime .
it ' s a classic when it comes to american literature . it won a pulitzer prize !
i ' m pretty unfamiliar with them , the only song of their ' s that i really know is sweet child o ' mine " , which was their only single to reach # 1 on the hot 100 .
their lead singer is ax ##l rose , while their lead guitarist is slash .
yeah he sounds a bit more familiar to me . he released 3 solo albums " slash , " " apocalyptic love " , and " world on fire . " all since 2010 .
i don ' t know much about the albums besides how awesome they sounded . however , i can tell you that slash left g ##nr in 1996 due to tensions with the lead singer ax ##l rose .
emotion pain that is severe can cause physical damage to the heart
this has dated back 3000 plus years and happens in many different cultures
the emotional aspects of a broken heart is believed to be survival instinct
the only thing i know about football is that the team with the most points at the end of a game wins lo ##l
it ' s okay : ) i just learned that the first match of american football was played on november 6 , 1869 ! can you believe that ? long time ago !
i bet players had lots of concussion ##s . you know it ' s funny that what people in other countries call football americans call soccer .
i have no clue : ) why didn ' t they just call it rugby since it originated from rugby
i like the trees and the green lawn in my compound
o ##oh really ? you can build a small garden that can use a very small irrigation system during the heat period
blue and yellow colors can actually give green
that ' s awesome . my favorite form of skiing is cross - country skiing . i love the mountainous terrain as well as groom ##ed courses . you experience a bizarre rush going down a mountain / hill !
definitely , i enjoy watching the fis nordic world ski championship . norway tends to have the most talented ski ##iers , they took home 5 gold medals last tournament .
they are generally held every other year . so it ' s a little more frequent than the olympics .
i do like some fantasy and was thinking that these novels of the life of a young wizard along with friends that are students would be a good read . what can you tell me about them ?
would you suggest reading the books over watching the movies ?
i have read that these books do have some criticism due to violence and the dark tone ; did you feel such was taking place when you read them ?
the lineup , when first signed to ge ##ffen records in 1986 so they consider themselves an 80s band .
guns n ' roses ' debut album , " appetite for destruction " probably has the most soul ##ful and unique rock style , that ##s why people love them so much .
the album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide , including 18 million units in the united states , making it the best - selling debut album of all time in the us . i think that ##s enough reason to at ##lea ##st listen to them on youtube .
i would recommend the twin albums " use your illusion i " and " use your illusion ii " ( 1991 ) as a starter .
mostly wildlife or feral animals and then i eat them .
yes , i adhere to the laws , lawful hunting is distinguished from po ##achi ##ng so i don ##t interfere with preservation policies !
i hunt coyotes , which is essential to maintain a population of healthy animals
the pressure continues eating
i love those little popcorn ##s
there are six different major kinds
popping of the kernel ##s extra butter
the books have sold over 500 million copies , so they are certainly popular , the best selling book series of all time actually !
i personally have not , when i saw how long the books were i decided that was too much for me , but i wish i had read them when i was young enough to like them
they have both adult and younger readers , but it is like pokemon in the sense that it is for everyone but still aimed at kids !
yes , it is a struggle against wizards and dark magic , and trying to overthrow evil
that sounds right , but i ' m not sure . i do know that yellowstone is one of 59 protected areas known as a national park , so it ' s definitely in a small group of national treasures .
you ' d probably have to travel across the entire continental us , and then to alaska because six national parks are there alone !
that ' s probably true . alaska is such a fascinating place , and it ' s so huge too , being the largest state in the us by area of course .
you might think so , but alaska is truly massive . despite its size though , there ' s only 73 ##8 , 43 ##2 people living there as of 2015 , not surprising i guess considering the climate .
it ' s a shame though . since skiing has existed for almost five millennia !
the word ski comes from old norse which means a split piece of fire ##wood or wood
what about about cross - country skiing ? that ' s where people move across all the snow - covered terrain rather than just using ski lifts .
i think so . water skiing would be even more fun . you can hold onto a cable behind a boat and ski ##m on the water ' s surface .
i love cross country . i only compete in amateur competitions but its such fun . i also love watching it in the olympics .
yes that ##s a good way of seeing it . it can be so fast though and thrilling . you have to use your own loco ##mot ##ion to cover the snowy terrain .
ski jumping is so exciting . it consists of the jumping ran , take off table and landing hill . i have never had the nerve to try it yet but watching the professionals is fascinating .
well u personally think bo ##de miller is one of the best , also tommy moe . there are lots though . another event i love to watch is ski flying , like jumping but they so ##ar through the air after the ramp for a long as possible !
i get taken back to those days in middle school when i listen to dave gr ##oh ##l of the foo fighters . his vocals songwriting hit me close to home .
my favorite song is " big me " on their debut album called " foo fighters " .
i also listened to another group dave gr ##oh ##l was apart of called them crooked vulture ##s . it was not one of his best groups .
yes , i ' m a huge fan of gr ##ung ##e music . queens of the stone age was another american gr ##ung ##e band , if you ' re familiar with the scene .
motivation is also one ' s direction to behavior or what makes you want to repeat an action .
yes , some people probably require more prompting to act in a certain way .
yes , having a positive stimulus definitely helps most people .
i agree , i will often pro ##cr ##ast ##inate if there is no " reward " !
interesting ##ly , ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is the largest contributor to green in nature ! red is nice , but green is where it ' s at !
it is very important in photos ##yn ##thesis , which allows plants to absorb energy from the light ! my high school science teacher would be proud of me for remembering that !
lo ##l ! here ' s another fun fact - emerald ##s are green too ! and its color comes form its ch ##rom ##ium content .
yes , and green is actually the biggest contributor in nature , by way of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l , which is a plant ' s chemical .
it does ! even in nature , green is the color animals will use to cam ##of ##lau ##ge themselves to protect them from danger .
yes , and it ' s so cool that on the visible spectrum , green is created by light , which has a controlling wavelength of around 495 ##57 ##0 nm . that ' s very technical terms lo ##l
their range of practice usually varies between countries , but usually includes autonomous decision and making around the emergency care of patients
para ##med ##ics work as emergency medical services and on an ambulance
it originally developed as a pr ##ap ##ro ##fe ##ssion in the united states in the 1970s
there are many colleges that offer para ##med ##ic courses . check your local college .
there ' s a lot to say about consulting firms . between 2010 and 2015 , the 10 biggest firms made a total of 170 billion dollars in growth revenue . and that ' s just the top 10 !
no , i haven ' t . consultants typically are usually trained in management or business .
never have . it would be interesting to hire one though . the advisory services vary so widely across organizations and countries . consulting firms are all over the world .
not my cup of tea but glad you liked it .
thanks and good luck !
i ' ve tried but could never really get into it - it starts with the main character waking up from a coma and realizing the world is overrun by zombies .
i should be completely interested in it - i mean it ' s filmed right here in atlanta - i even have friends that have run into the actors just around town .
yeah maybe i ' ll give it another go - it has attracted the most 18 - 49 year old viewers of any cable or broadcast tv series - all those people can ' t be wrong .
i wonder if it ' s rated as high as the actual show - apparently it ' s actually unprecedented ##ly high on the nielsen ratings .
that ' s cool ! i am really into street style and i like posting photos about it .
street style is british fashion culture that is new . what style do you like ?
gothic style is very interesting . a lot of kids in high school use to dress like that . i was more into hip hop fashion in high school .
well some people think that do ##pa ##mine ##rg ##ic drugs help build motivation .
yu ##p that kind of " wanting behavior " can also be cause by do ##pa ##mine ##rg ##ic drugs .
sleeping maybe , but most forms of motivation actually have neurological roots .
it ' s about a wizard and his friends . they struggle against an evil wizard named vol ##de ##mo ##rt who wants to overthrow the wizard government . harry , the main character almost died to this evil wizard himself as a baby !
eight ! but once you start book one i almost guarantee you will bing ##e read them
be aware that its known for its increasingly dark tone as the books get later into the series . also , a lot of graphic and gr ##ues ##ome violence
yes , she owns the chain ! dylan ' s candy bar is stocked over 7 , 000 around the world .
that ' s the one . she was inspired to create the store because of the movie , " willy won ##ka & the chocolate factory " .
yes , and her motto is that she wants to " merge fashion , art and pop candy culture " . i guess with the money daddy has , she can merge whatever she wants .
it ' s cool that it was based on the comic book series
and most of the series take place in atlanta , georgia
i can ' t believe it premiered 8 years ago on october 31
yu ##p , and walking dead attracted the most 18 to 45 year old viewers of any cable tv series
they released the best of nickel ##back and then vanished .
they are from alberta in canada all right .
chad k ##ro ##eger is the leading vocalist of the group .
ryan peak ##e is the keyboardist an mike k ##ro ##eger is the bassist .
no so it ' s actually a chain of boutique candy shops !
no it doesn ' t make clothes , boutique as in art ##isi ##nal ! it was inspired by willy won ##ka
it is how the boutique candy shop is , which is owned by dylan lauren .
i haven ' t visited the shop , but it ' s in large cities like chicago , la , and new york .
yes following rules , and making notes and lists is very helpful
yes a place to put different objects and ideas , a cell phone is an excellent tool . it is a place to logical ##ly organize facts and ideas and also reminder ##s
really anything that helps keep you organized or that helps you keep a lot of information in 1 place to refer back to is useful
i like paper organizing myself , i have notebook ##s for bills , when they are due and when i pay . keeping everything arranged for easier access
yep , when ada ##ir replaced drummer ryan vi ##ked ##al . it caused quite a stir amongst the fans .
yep but despite that they ' re still one of the most commercially successful canadian groups . hard to believe right ?
hate ##rs probably need to listen to " how you remind me " , which was listed as the best - selling rock song .
humans mostly hunt for food but some hunt for recreation or sport and some to remove predators
i also hunt to remove predators they are dangerous to livestock and domestic animals
yes and the species i am hunting is called prey or game and is often mammals or birds
yes and hunting is a part of modern wildlife mana ##gm ##ent
be ##rk ##ley , michigan . have you herd of jug ##gal ##o championship wrestling ?
it ' s a fan of the group that ' s a man . a female is a jug ##ale ##tte .
when you have a band that has platinum and five gold albums you have a lot of fans .
one dose the other is to fat . they mostly just think about the mythology of the dark carnival , a metaphor ##ic limb ##o in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities .
the castle of me ##ud ##on , called the royal castle of me ##ud ##on is green inside as well
it was actually in star wars the first movie
steve robson actually wrote all the music for the movie
she could have been ! she loved music . she even named my middle sister lisa marie . ha ##ha
i ' m not much of an elvis fan , and i was mistaken . he was born in 1935 , but his career began in 1954 . o ##ops ! are you an elvis fan ?
you have a band ? that ' s awesome ! i love music . i especially enjoy acoustic shows . i like the it without all the auto - tuning and stuff .
there are many you should research on the internet . entry is usually through a competitive audition process though
i don ; t remember . but audition usually involve the performance of mono ##logue ##s and group workshops , so you should be prepared for that .
all type of drama and also design and technical theatre . one i would recommend is ju ##illa ##rd school .
cool . he was referred to as the " king of rock " , or just " the king " when he was alive .
wow he would be an old man . he began recording at sun records with producer sam phillips in 1954 . that seems like a long time ago now .
yes , i have seen some of his movies . in 1955 , colonel tom parker arranged a recording contract with rca victor for presley . this really put him on the map and on the charts .
i know there is ali guess kind of a survival horror type show / comic / game

ye ##a , imagine having to do four years of undergraduate education , four years of medical school , and seven years of residency . so much investment !
pediatric ne ##uro ##sur ##ger ##y is the most complicated one , don ##t you think ?
many other creatures would beg to differ , a lot of them have adapted to their green environments by taking on their own green color to their skin .
green is between yellow and blue on the color spectrum so i think if they can see one of those colors than they can definitely see the other .
yes , and ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is the largest contributor to green in the world . it ' s a chemical that plants produce into energy to sustain life .
in that case ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l would probably have a different name . ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is derived from the greek words ch ##lor ##os ph ##yl ##lon meaning green leaf .
did you buy their sixth studio album . it has over 100 million records worldwide sales
i will find out what the name of the album is . do you know about their debut too ? it is called " appetite for destruction " and released in 1987

i actually don ' t know . i don ' t think anyone knows . but a broken heart can actually cause physical damage to the heart called " broken heart syndrome "

ha yeah ! until you lose your ski ##is in the woods ! ha ##ha

yes nirvana ! their debut album was called b ##lea ##ch
their main success though was definitely smells like teen spirit
che ##ar ##lea ##ding is very st ##ren ##uous . especially now that it also considered a competitive sport in itself . routines range from one to three minutes . the routines contain lots of tumbling and jumps .
that is a difficult move . i love how in 1997 cheerleading became an international competition . it was even aired on espn .
its such a fun movie . to think that most people think cheerleading is only about cheering on your team for encouragement have no idea how hard it can be is crazy .
it is a mixture of yellow and blue in sub ##tra ##ctive color systems though .
the dominant wavelength is also 495 ##57 ##0 nm .

he was called the " king of rock and roll " or some just call him " the king " and he was one of the biggest icons of the 20th century .
it is so tragic ! his first single " heartbreak hotel " became number 1 in the united states .
he came from such a small town , when he was born in tu ##pel ##o , mississippi and moved to memphis when he was 13 . who would have guessed he would be the king ! lo ##l
he was so generous and often gave away vehicles ! his series of tv appearances and top singles made him the leading figure of the sound of rock and roll .
he was actually the founder of the mongol empire !
he became powerful by un ##ifying the nomadic tribes of northeast asia and he died in 122 ##7 .
exactly , he launched mongol invasions and conquered the majority of eu ##rasia .
it really was , though these campaigns were accompanied by huge amounts of killings of civilians so he wasn ' t the greatest guy .

ham ##bone is when you get four consecutive strikes . i ' ve never gotten that .

i believe it ' s similar to the color spectrum , the visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum which is visible to the human eye .
i ' m not sure of all the colors in the visible spectrum , but i k now some are not included such as pink and mage ##nta because they are a mix of multiple wavelengths .
i think that ' s correct , i forgot about " roy ##gb ##iv " . green has also been helpful in nature by playing a role in ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l that plants use .
yes , i was very sad after the death ##ly hall ##ows was released in 2007
because it was the final chapter in the harry potter series . it dealt with the events involving the final confrontation between the wizards and vol ##de ##mo ##rt .
vol ##de ##mo ##rt appears in all the books either in form of a flashback or in person . with the exception of the prisoner of az ##ka ##ban where they only mention him .
harry potter has the power to van ##qui ##sh him according to prophecy . all is revealed in the death ##ly hall ##ows . i would recommend reading it .
you are very welcome , i hope you enjoy reading all the harry potter books as much as i have .
you know , " ski " is a norse word . i think that explains a lot . vikings like painful ho ##bbies .
yeah . they used to have one ski for gliding and one for kicking . sounds like a better version of today ##s snow ##board . we ' re reg ##ress ##ing .
i didn ' t know that . do you think that would work for water skier ##s too ? the canvas might get wet . and you ' d need a miracle to carry it across the surface of the water ! !
so it would take me three hours to smash off a cheese ##cake factory cake from barnes & noble . de ##pressing .
don ' t they have a large rivalry with uc ##f that started in 2005 ?
their head coach josh he ##up ##el used to me an offensive coordinator at my school , the university of missouri .

ah yes . sam phillips also was connected to johnny cash .
they are high achieve ##rs who had released six studio albums , acc ##um ##ulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide , including 45 million in the united states .

yu ##p , i ' ve read about it the other day . do you use hash ##tag ##s on your posts ? it helps to link photos to other content on ins ##tagram
i ' m so glad now we can up ##load media at full size and not in square
i have some investments in mutual funds , but not in individual shares .
it depends on various factors , but i find that the holding period is most important . you have to be able to stick it out through economic swings .
unless you ' re talking about an enormous and sustained down ##turn , most of the time if you wait long enough you will recover , so i tend to be optimistic that will occur . the market is volatile by nature , you have to be patient .
absolutely ! many funds now allow small investments , and so long as you don ' t try the high risk funds , making a little profit will usually encourage you to invest more .
pick the highest rated fund from a google search , see if it offers self or small investment , and put $ 50 in it ! it ' s that simple ! good luck !

you aim to knock over the pins at the end
strikes are the best when you knock over all the pins in one bowl
ye ##a i loved bowling
i guess they just torque their wrist in a certain way , seems hard though . i think if you get three strikes in a row it ' s called a turkey , how weird is that .
i ' m not sure to be honest , but going to back to weird terms , apparently four strikes in a row is called a " ham ##bone " , where do they come up with these names ?
apparently once you get past 3 , you just add the word bag ##ger to the number of strikes , so i guess it ' d be a five - bag ##ger !
it is the second largest island in the british isles , which means it has always attracted a lot of attention !
i agree , unfortunately the population of ireland was about 6 . 6 million and it has since grown .

i am not sure , they typically hold their own . the first record of a skier is from 1741
nobody in particular , there has not been a stand out in the way michael phelps is , for example

ms ( multiple sc ##ler ##osis ) is a dem ##ye ##lina ##ting disease in which the ins ##ulating covers of nerve cells in the brain are damaged , unfortunately we did not fully cure him though made it a lot easier for him
the main clinical measure in progression of the disability and severity of the symptoms is the expanded disability status scale or eds ##s , if you ever see these symptoms please do consult your local doctor , of course we have some kind of treatment but i hope that in the future technology advances very far where we can completely cure people of this disease

they have explored so many musical styles throughout the years
i love them . they are the progressive band that started up in 1985 and went by the name majesty at the time
i imagine it was too difficult and probably why they started using two poles back in 1741 . lo ##l
i guess so lo ##l . of course , i would think in environments were snow covered the ground , they probably used ski ##s as a means of transportation , all those years ago .

it can be so foreign ! when i first started courses , i was struck by all the different fields in accounting from financial to management to , the one everyone is scared of , audit ##ing . ha ha

i am not too old , mainly lazy . originally ins ##tagram only allowed photos to be uploaded in a distinct square shape .

well for the most part we all like to eat meat , so maybe it ' s just his natural instinct to want to hunt .

one star on lap ##el the lowest ran , up to i think 5 stars for the highest . maybe 4 . so a 1 star general not as important as a 4 star general .

who cares about them ! its also known as grid ##iro ##n football or simply grid ##iro ##n

rock music of canada is a wide and diverse part of the general music of canada

i do cross - country skiing
its a type of move across snow - covered terrain , rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance
it has a a history of almost five millennia
there is even a whole science behind the study of color called color psychology .
sure thing ! it covers many different topics including how color can even influence the taste of food .
it ' s crazy how much color influences our daily lives . this changes as we get older and even differs between gender ##s !
it doesn ' t differ all that much . society has influenced gender through colors like blue and pink for masculine and feminine .
yes , i thought it was good as well . it is an extension of the wizard ##ing world from the harry potter series .

the role varies wildly in responsibilities , it evolved as a para ##pro ##fe ##ssion in the united states during the 1970s .
i ' m not sure , but para ##med ##ic role is closely related to other healthcare positions . para ##med ##ical ##s usually have more responsibility and autonomy than a medical tech role .
not really in the usa , they more of prepare the patient for the doctors . however the scope of the role varies in the area that they practice .

oh wow , i would have thought it was dyed that color . he definitely made himself known as the lead person of rock and roll !
that ' s so cool ! i would have never known otherwise . it ' s always great to learn something new ,
that sounds like an interesting sandwich . he began his music career in 1954 , and wanted to bring a different sound of music to a wide audience .
true . can you believe that it ' s said the emotional " pain " of a broken heart is believed to be part of the survival instinct .
well i am actually a ps ##ych major and " social - attachment system " uses the " pain system " to encourage humans to maintain their close social relationships by causing pain when those relationships are lost .
yes , although the neurological process involved in the perception of heart ##ache is not known , but is thought to involve the anterior ci ##ng ##ulate cortex of the brain , which during stress may overs ##ti ##mu ##late the va ##gus nerve causing pain , nausea or muscle tight ##ness in the chest ; which is ins ##ame how our mind can interact with out bodies
what about college football ? that ##s where the rules first gained popularity in the us right ?
did you ever watch the x ##fl although it only had one season on 2001 /

i totally get that . skiing has been around for almost five millennia .
ha ##ha ##ha . yes , it ' s very bulky . and the boots ! i felt like frankenstein trying to walk in those things . i read that the work " ski " was exported from norway .
oh yes , because it concerns the human brain . it can also be referred to as brain surgery
its not really a new thing , students study hard for it , the united states , a ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##on must generally complete four years of undergraduate education , four years of medical school
oh yes , in most countries , ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##on training requires a minimum period of seven years
i do not know exactly where they are from . most came over the great potato famine to avoid starvation between 1845 - 1849
over a million people died during that period and another million left ireland . it was caused by potato b ##light .
it is a disease that affects the potato plant . in ireland 2 / 5 of the population was solely re ##lian ##t on potatoes at the time
there is a potato virus which results in production loss , but also can cause rings ##pot disease and makes the potatoes un ##market ##able
i like plants which explains why i like green so much , ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is the largest contributor to green in nature .
absolutely , in fact that is why many creatures have adapted by taking on a green hue as camouflage so they can hide in nature .
well my affinity for green makes since because the color green has a long history in ireland and gaelic culture , and that ##s where a lot of my ancestors are from .
well it depends on how much whisky you pour lo ##l , i like my irish coffee strong .
im not sure as there are different variation of this coffee .
the original recipe uses cream that has not been whipped .
yeah , the original recipe uses it , im not sure if it tastes good though .
it kinda makes sense , since american football or grid ##iro ##n doesn ' t involve the foot that much .
that must be nice ha ##ha . it involves two teams and a rectangular field .
it might be that american football has caused brain damage and concussion ##s and all that .
since it is one of the major throwing sports , it is a lot lok ##e the javelin throw .
i think it is . have you ever gone pin bowling , where you are trying to knock down the pins with a small ball ?
called duck ##pin bowling , you use a 5 inch ball that weighs around 3 pounds .
search the web . the pins are shorter , lighter and smaller than regular pins , so it is still difficult .
ha ##ha ! i know ! i can spend hours testing various digital filters for my photos ! it ' s so addict ##ing !

you definitely should ! you ' re coming in at a great time too . users are able to up ##load photos at full size . previously , users could only up ##load photos that were a square shape .
i don ' t but would love to go to ireland and buy one ! it just reminds me of the irish !
it has the culture of the united kingdom with a liberal democracy and is a major power . i just like the people , though .
the united kingdom of gb and northern ireland is is western europe .
well , definitely a large country . in 2011 , its population was 1 , 81 ##0 , 86 ##3 !
i only have used the bowling balls provided at the bowling alley . most of the time i use the 12 ##lb ball . most of the time i hold the ball in the palm of my hand when i throw it .
the accuracy of the bowling ball really boil ##s down to practice and using the same ball over and over again .
you would have to start out playing in local leagues and then move your way up . you would have to do very well , because it is one of the major throwing sports and is very competitive .
it takes a lot of practice , to get the maximum score of 300 , you have to score 12 strikes in a row .
no i have not gone skiing
i don ' t play any sports , but i do like long distance running
it requires a lot of st ##amina to keep up , but also mental tough ##ness to stay with it
ha ##ha , yeah i know right . ! but if you wanted to try something else that is less protein , there are a variety of herbal con ##co ##ctions and tonic ##s available on the market . in fact these have also been used for centuries by ancient athletes to increase their strength and st ##amina
yeah , i have heard of that too , that is also a great choice , but it is also important to note that it is a dietary supplement which no longer requires approval from the u . s . food and drug administration before the distribute the product . so it may not be as safe as you think to take it
yes you will , or you can always go on a ke ##to diet , which is also great for getting a lot of protein in your diet !
ha ##ha , i know what you mean , i would never be able to give up car ##bs either .

i especially like the functionality of websites like amazon for shopping . the have a great search feature that allows me to find specific models , brands and items .
i agree ! i also like how most online shopping websites allow consumers to view photos of the product , along with features , reviews and prices . you can ' t easily find that much information in a brick and mortar store !
yes , that ' s possible . that ' s why it ' s important to only shop from online stores that you can trust . i typically go straight to trust ##worthy sites rather than relying on shopping search engines which gives me the lowest price .
i love rocks that look greenish . several have a green color such as emerald ##s . do you like emerald ##s ?
emerald ##s have a classification of tough ##ness as poor .

yes and the emerald gets its green color from its ch ##rom ##ium content
then have you considered poultry farming . you can domestic ##ated birds such as chickens yourself

luca pac ##iol ##i established the modern field of accounting way back in 149 ##4 . he was an italian mathematician .
ye ##a that surprised me also . accounting is also known as the " language of business " . it convey ##s financial information to management , creditors , and investors about an entities position
accounting has different fields . there is external , management , tax , and cost accounting .
external accounting does sure . when you here the term " financial reporting " that is synonymous with " accounting "

in nature green is the color of cho ##lor ##phy ##ll
its cool how many creatures in nature change colors to match the natural green environment
in middle ages green was associated with wealth , bankers , merchants
green is also the traditional color for irish and gaelic cultures
you know how it is , people will take anything if they ' re led to believe it helps them at all . people have taken herbal con ##co ##ctions and tonic ##s before - - strong men / athletes - - since ancient times , and this includes all cultures , just because they want an edge in strength / st ##amina .
but you have some smart , logical vision ##aries in there , too . like back in the 1910s , you had eugen sand ##ow , one of the first to be considered a modern body ##bu ##ilde ##r - - he advocated everyone in the western part of the world to simply use dietary control to help out your muscle growth . common sense does come around sometimes .
but then you ' d have people like body ##bu ##ilde ##r earle lied ##erman saying we needed to use " beef juice " and " beef extract " to enhance muscle recovery . so , it ' s hit or miss .
there may be some reasoning to it . i guess if it ' s not harmful , what ' s the worst that could happen , right ? ir ##vin p . johnson , a competitive body ##bu ##ilde ##r from the 1950s , around the time when that stuff was becoming really popular , he popularized egg - based protein powder ##s . probably not far off from what we see now . and then since the ' 70s and ' 80s , the market has just increased dramatically for body ##building supplements .

nope , apparently since the 1950 ' s .
well , green is dominated by a wavelength of 495 ##57 ##0 nm . what do you mean by universal ?
ah yes , i understand . and you ' re right . there are many different shades of it . the biggest source of green come from nature in the form of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l . it ' s the chemical plants make . do you have any plants ?
yes , green has a long tradition for the color of gaelic culture in ireland . it ' s so fascinating !
it ' s like it doesn ' t matter if i ' m trying to do something positive for myself , or even do something that takes me away from something negative , i just feel like doing nothing .
i don ' t have any problems with poor work ethics . i know that my work is always high - quality and i always stay on track in the office . at home is another story though .

if you ever get a chance to visit the west coast , i ' d recommend mi ##ur woods in california . it ' s also a national park .

it seems that it may also have been practiced more than 100 centuries ago in china according to ancient paintings !
seems early skier ##s used one long pole or a spear - i guess maybe they were hunting at the same time lo ##l !
apparently they had one long ski for sliding and one short ski for kicking - so no balancing really i don ' t guess .
