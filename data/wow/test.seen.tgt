well , they ' re boys and girls choirs , school choirs and professional performing choirs .
ah , you should , if you like signing you ' d love to join a choir , just make sure you like the conductor , he ' s the one who leads the performances with gestures .

yeah ! we ' re not sure what breed she is , because we rescued her , but there are all sorts of different types of breeds and sizes of horses .
i ' m not sure , but they have so many different domestic ##ated breeds and a lot of wild feral horses as well . she might be an arabian horse . . . those seem to be pretty common !
you would think they would be white ! beauty is a white horse too : ) that ' s how i picture arabian horses ! they were originally bred for war and trade
yeah ! they were also used to pull chariot ##s and wagons ! it ' s so fun to imagine beauty ' s ancestors as pulling chariot ##s .
there are several people that are famous in their specific industry , in this case , make - up for movies . a good example is john chambers .
i am to a point , i do not spend too many hours on it but i do believe that co ##sm ##eto ##logy can make a massive difference in how people can portray themselves .
that is very true and i believe co ##sm ##eto ##logy has now a big influence over social media which at the end of the day can have a positive or negative impact on people . on the negative side , you can be badly influenced into a non ac ##hi ##eva ##ble look and beauty standards but at the same time it ' s creative and people can discuss a positive improvements to their lives via co ##sm ##eto ##logy .
maybe , it is aldo understood by scholars as a modern phenomena with a cultural dimension . .
well , that been bored can be not only accepted but encouraged in some cultures as a status symbol .
and even when there is not universally accepted definition of boredom , researchers assure of that it is not to be confused with depression .
and even when accord ##in to the bbc news boredom can be a dangerous state of mind that damages your health , i disagree .
early factories had small amounts of machinery and fewer than a dozen workers . times sure have changed
now we are in huge warehouses and it ' s assembly line production all day and all night . never stops
assembly lines are the best and most used way to assemble complex item , like our cars for example , or appliances and electronics . brilliant i think
do you practice vegetarian ##ism due to religious beliefs ?
oh i see . being a vegetarian is hard . do you find yourself having to explain you eating habits to people ?
may i ask what kind of health issue prohibits eating meat ?
wow that ' s really cool . i know that normally people surf in the ocean but you can also apparently surf in lakes and rivers as well in the form of standing wave or tidal bore
yeah i just read about it . surfer ##s can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes or artificial wave pools
yeah i bet it would . the term " surfing " refers to the act of riding a wave regardless of whether the wave is ridden with a board and regardless of the stance used .
actually another type of surfing is body boarding , when a surfer rides a wave on a body board either lying on their stomach , drop knee , or sometimes even standing up on a body board
ours is a pretty good size , my girls have volunteered there quite a bit and they will even have some sick tropical animals from time to time .
i ' m glad to live in a state that has the georgia animal protection act - it was in response to inhuman ##e treatment of animals at a pet chain store here in atlanta .
i ' m really glad they don ' t call them pounds any more - we ' ve adopted all of our dogs from a shelter or a rescue . i ' ll never buy another animal
yeah especially since he is known for his slap ##stick performances !
i like him a lot , i think he ' s genuine because he can do anything . he was in dumb and dumb ##er and had a little different role in liar liar
yeah his very serious role in eternal sunshine of the spot ##less mind was pretty intense
well he is still working as a producer and other things , so maybe you will run into him at an event
i ' ve not used marker pens much . but , i ' ve always wanted to try sketch pens .
there just a special type of marker pen that is designed for drawing , and not just writing .
there is such a wide availability of drawing tools . its amazing how each artist uses them differently .
i feel like its hard to keep a lot of colors stored in paint . you have to have something hold all those bottles of liquid .
the marathon was the original olympic event that started in 1896 .
yeah , and it continues till today . there are around 800 marathon ##s held every year through out the world ! most runners are recreation ##s rather than professionals .
the first athlete was a greek messenger called pu ##ili ##pp ##ides and from him is where the word marathon comes from .
sure ! she presents choreographed violin performances , both live and in music videos found on her eponymous youtube channel ,
her music video " crystal ##li ##ze " finished as the eighth - most watched video of 2012 , and her cover version of " radioactive " with pen ##tat ##oni ##x won response of the year
crystal ##li ##ze , a song by american violinist lindsey stirling from her self - titled studio album
stirling ' s eponymous debut album was a commercial success in europe , selling 200 , 000 copies in germany , winning a platinum certification ; three additional certification ##s were given by austria
we just have a general hospital in our area with an er and can handle urgent health issues i guess - but i hope i never have to go there , i don ' t think they are competent .
we have a few others , but they are a bit farther away . there are some specialized ones like for trauma , rehab , children ' s , cancer , etc .
there are even some teaching hospitals around - i " m sorry , but i don ' t really want someone learning on me !
i guess , but if i were to have a heart attack , i wouldn ' t want a student in a spec ##ili ##zed card ##iology unit making all the calls .
its great to un ##wind and relax and play a few tunes , especially with friends round . there are 3 main types , the acoustic guitar , the steel - string and the arch ##top . i have just about mast ##ed the steel string so far .
the oldest guitar is around 350 ##0 years old ! the modern guitar was preceded by the gi ##tter ##n , then the vi ##hue ##la and before that the four course renaissance guitar .
well i think the cool ##est are the electric guitars . they use one or more pickup ##s to convert the string vibrations into electric signals . examples are the fender st ##rat ##oca ##ster or the gibson les paul
you can pick up a cheap guitar for 40 dollars but for the the fender st ##rat ##oca ##ster you can be talking 1500 dollars or more ! !
unfortunately true as most persons are not looking for meaningful relationships but just hook ##ups . can you believe its ju ##s tb ##een 6 years since tin ##der cam e ##out in 2012 ! it seems it has been around much longer
i guess my courtship may seem archaic to many today . my husband and i had cha ##per ##one and he even asked my parents for permission ##s to marry . getting to know each other in fun settings
no relationship is perfect but a courtship based on respecting boundaries while getting to know each other before marriage have resulted in a strong relationship for the past 18 years .
more traditional values and court ##ing practices can still work today . it is a refreshing change to a person ##e who had a long line of casual hook ##ups . it doesn ; t mean the male has to do all the court ##ing but just be respectful of yourself and others .
well the last of the mo ##hic ##ans is an epic historical drama . it was set in 1757 during the indian and french war .
the great daniel day - lewis was in the last of the mo ##hic ##ans . it also stars jo ##dhi may and madeleine st ##owe .
i can really recall . i do know that the last of the mo ##hic ##ans received nearly universal praise and commercial success during its run in the box - office .
it is ev ##oked by light
it is a primary color in sub ##tra ##ctive color system
it is used for painting and printing
it absorb ##s light energy and protects plants
yes it ' s great fun ! i want to get into yacht racing soon , i think i need to start with a ding ##hy first though .
sure ! i found out the other day that racing sail boats first started in the netherlands some time in the 17th century
yes , we started racing custom - built yacht ##s in england soon afterwards . the first big race ha ##pped in 1851 , where the royal yacht squadron raced the american yacht " america " in cow ##es . " america " won . . .
it becomes an obsession , that ' s for sure ! my friends basically spend all their cash on their yacht . but they ' re always off to cow ##es and the isle of wight so they almost live on it now ! they ' re looking to buy a larger yacht so they can go on extended voyages to other places !
i ' m sure you ' ll love it ! it ' s becoming my dream one day to do that too
oh definitely ! tom and jerry is a classic . they were created by hanna barber ##a .
they go way back to 1940 . i think my favorite cartoon on cartoon network by far is adventure time .
it ' s about a boy named finn and his best friend , jake . they live in a post - apocalyptic world called " o ##oo "
jake is a magical dog that can stretch into any shape and size . it ' s a really funny show !
i think they are made by has ##bro - interesting ##ly , the show garnered a lot of praise from parental groups and television critics ! that doesn ' t happen often !
the show was actually developed to appeal to girls , their target demographic ! but my son loves the show anyway !
there ' s quite a fan ##dom out there - they call themselves bro ##nies or bro ##ny - that ' s a combination of " bro " and " pony " lo ##l
bro ##ny ##con ? i don ' t know when the next one is , but the 2016 bro ##ny ##con had 7 , 60 ##9 attendees !
lots of other movements are said to have dance like qualities . like martial arts , gymnastics , figure skating , swimming , etc .
i like when dance tells a story , like in mi ##me , or acc ##omp ##anies a musical piece
i don ' t know . there is ballet and modern dance and some are set to dramas i believe
it ' s good exercise and helps with coordination and balance too ,
a piano has 88 keys , which are essentially small lever ##s which you press down on and cause the little hammer ##s inside to strike the strings .
the main difference is that the " forte ##pia ##nos " , as they were then called , had a quieter sound and smaller range than their modern counterparts .
there are differences between piano manufacturers . the most famous is pro ##ba ##bla ##y stein ##way & sons , founded in manhattan in 1853 .
yes they do . their factory in new york makes pianos for the americas and their hamburg factory manufactures pianos for the rest of the world .
take for example , reaction time . . it gets slower as we get older .
aging can refer to single cells within an organism that has ceased dividing . .
just an aging human lo ##l . it ' s a risk factor for roughly the 150 , 000 people who die each day from age related disease . lots of people die in the month of august .
so did i ! did you actually go on sundays or saturdays ? some churches have theirs on saturdays .
i totally understand . sunday was a really slow day for my family as well . only church and resting .
i have heard that . in fact , i don ' t think sunday shopping was allowed where i grew up .
i guess store owners need rest and church too !
yeah i found out adoption can be done by a couple or an individual person
well unlike guardians ##hip or other systems designed for the care of the young , adoption is intended to effect a permanent change .
pretty much but historically , some societies have enacted specific laws governing adoption
sure the modern systems of adoption , arising in the 20th century
pit ##a dates all the way back to 2500 bc ! its pretty old !
yeah ! the first mention of the word in english however only dates back to the 30 ' s
the english word is borrowed from modern greek π ##ι ##τ ##α . and a rough translation for that is bread cake ! pretty interesting huh ?
it ' s good that you were able to achieve functional mental health , and a satisfactory level of adjustment . also , some people stay married for the worse , so good that your parents moved on ok . are you married now ?
good not to make the same mistakes . the well - being factor of marriage is quite a big one related to happiness , and overall quality of life .
yes i ' m married . my advice is find common ground in everything from decor , to food , to you name it . all of these well - being factors are studied in psychology , and very beneficial .
bearded dragons are really social lizards , i just love it . i hear they can get to be a bit territorial with other lizards though !
there are a few different kinds of bearded dragons . i think the common kind people keep as pets is the eastern bearded dragon native to australia .
they also very social like i said . their ability to form a bond with people is part of why bearded dragons are so popularly kept as a pet .
the best historical writers are usually remembered among their respective societies
you just need motivation to work on your writing more to become truly successful .
you just have to keep thinking about the end goal of where your efforts will take you
go see the headquarters of the united nations for sure
i am not sure but can you believe one city has 23 . 7 million residents ?
yes indeed and its a power city its the cultural , financial and media capitol of the whole world
yes and its so fast paced that ##s where the phrase new york minute comes from
my kids love to collect the rocks , sand for whatever reason , cool gravel and beautiful pebbles . you go much ?
i love it so much . we always hope to walk so far along the shore that we find und ##is ##co ##vered beaches
hey , you know what they say , right ? a shark will shed 35 , 000 teeth in their lifetime . you have good odds finding a few lo ##l
the word pit ##a goes back to 1936 .
it comes from wheat flour .
i am not sure but it is used in many mediterranean cuisine ##s .
no but any dish with spices .
i ' m not sure , there are quite a few . alpine skiing has been an event at the winter olympics since 1936 !
i have no idea . there is estimated to be 55 million people worldwide who engage in alpine skiing !
europe , 30 million people actively ski there
15 million ! quite a lot but not like europe
it was named for the colorado river by the spanish travelers because of the si ##lt the river carried from the mountains .
i don ' t know the density , but the population was 5 , 540 , 54 ##5 on july 1 , 2016 .
i do not have that information . it is nicknamed the " centennial state " because it became a state a century after the us declaration of independence was signed .
it is well noted for its vivid landscape of mountains , mesa ##s , canyon ##s , and rivers .
skate ##boarding has been around for decades , but in the 1970s they started constructing skate ##park ##s so people could use skate ##boards , sc ##oot ##ers , and b ##mx bikes on them .
tony hawk is one of the most famous skate ##board ##ers , there are over 11 . 08 million active skate ##board ##ers in the world ! so many people .
i think so if you are just beginning , skate ##boarding has been influenced by so many skate ##board ##ers through the years , and i ' m sure they advocate safety first .
i can imagine so . i find it interesting that " cr ##oche ##t " comes from french which means " small hook " . so basic if you ask me .
i found that silly too . there are different types of cr ##oche ##t you may want to look into like tunisian and broom ##stick lace .
that ' s awesome . do you use a metal , wood , or plastic hook ? they ' re all popular .
very nice . i imagine that feels much stu ##rdi ##er . also , cr ##oche ##t comes from the germanic cr ##oc that means hook . so it ' s never had a creative name . ha ##h !
it was first deployed in 2011 on facebook ' s news ##fe ##ed .
i don ' t know about that one .
well , it was influenced by x ##hp , an html component framework for php .
cool ! most kay ##aks have closed decks and a sit on top type seating . some kay ##aks are in ##fl ##atable and they are growing in popularity . do you like to fish also ?
fishing from a kay ##ak is becoming popular due to its appeal as an environmentally friendly and healthy way of getting around . also , they are relatively low in cost compared to motorized boats .
do you think you will join your husband is fishing from a kay ##ak ? it sounds like fun !
it ' s the latin name of the tomato plant , which belongs to the nights ##had ##e family , " sol ##ana ##ceae "
i am not sure , but maybe it ' s related to some plants in western south america , where the species originated
the spanish brought it to europe in the 16th century after discovering it from their contact with the aztec peoples
they are indeed healthy , and are consumed in diverse ways . many dishes , sauce ##s , salad ##s , and drinks include tomato as an ingredient
just the way it is i guess , oddly the united nations defines a orphan as anyone who loses one parent
not sure but a lot of famous writers , notable scientist & world leaders are orphans as well
i think the orphans who are adopted are no longer orphans if that makes sense
i have noticed there are many fictional characters that are orphans
do most of your stories appear on a website as on online newspaper or in traditional print ?
that ' s pretty neat ! is your newspaper published daily or weekly ?
i ' ll bet that ' s a fun job . it ' s hard to believe that newspapers have been around since the 17th century , isn ' t it ?
i ' ll bet it was quite a task ! north and south america didn ' t get into publishing newspapers until the 19th century .
my fishing tackle consists mostly of hooks and sink ##ers .
have you ever been fly fishing ?
no , you are just using an artificial fly to catch the fish .
yes . i would suggest getting some good hook , line and sink ##ers to help .
ye ##a its seattle is a city in west of the united states .
its the king county of washington
no but seattle seems like a cool city , want to visit washington sometime
mine are probably american long ##hair ##s , since they ' re so big and so furry . mine loves to eat mice since they ' re car ##nivorous .
it ' s just one of the per ##ks of owning a house cat or even an outdoor fe ##line .
i ' m sure it is fun , since they are great for companions ##hip and for their ability to hunt .
it is ! it comes from a specific breed of wa ##gy ##u cattle that is bred in japan . most kobe in the united states is actually mis ##lab ##ele ##d .
kobe beef specifically has to come from the prefecture of h ##yo ##go , while wa ##gy ##u can be any beef from japan .
yeah . so it is likely that you have had wa ##gy ##u but not kobe . wa ##gy ##u is still awesome though , it contains a higher percentage of omega - 3 and omega - 6 fatty acids than other beef .
part of the reason kobe is so specialized is because japan was effectively isolated from the rest of the world from 1635 until 1854 ; there was no possibility of intro ##mission of foreign genes to the cattle population at the time .
sure , they line up behind the line of sc ##rim ##mage , hence their name . they are the backup of the line .
my favorite is di ##k but ##kus of the chicago bears . he is now retired but he was fun to watch .
yes the bears have been my favorite my whole life . i have been to their games twice .
the bears won the 1985 super bowl . since then they have had good years and bad years .
in quebec there is a chain of rot ##isse ##rie chicken restaurants called st hubert . have you ever been ?
if you don ' t make it to quebec , every other place in canada has chain called swiss cha ##let . it ' s pretty similar .
me too ! i also love bb ##q chicken , especially on a grill .
have you ever seen the movie into the woods ? it takes a lot from the rap ##un ##zel and cinderella stories , and is a pretty good musical .
i loved wicked ! it ' s one of my favorite musicals too . i also went and read the gregory maguire book it was based on , have you read that ?
oh wow . i don ' t even know how many books there are in that series . how much of the fictional land of oz does he cover through the books ?
it is a very reliable car , so much that it is an official state car for transporting members of the government
bmw is not only built in germany but also in brazil , china , and the us
yes there is and it is the 12th largest producer of motor vehicles in the world
well first you get to be the fantasy " general manager " of your team
all of the people ( managers ) involved participate in a draft , you get to pick real players in the nfl
i think some people do , not sure if that is legal though , also your points are accumulated based on the real players and how they do during the season
yes , father ' s are just as capable as parents . i know i am a great parent to my children , but i am blessed that they also have a great mother .
is there a single one of you that is listed as the cu ##sto ##dial parent ? i cannot imagine having to be away from my kids for a couple weeks at a time , but i am sure if it is an un ##hea ##lth ##y marriage , joint custody is better .
the whole concept of a parenting coordinator is new to me . my state does not have that option , instead one parent is chosen as a cu ##sto ##dial parent , and the other generally has to pay the bulk of any expenses , and see the children less often .
in the old days , children were believed to belong to the father , as the default .
they used for keeping plants or animals
fish keepers use aqua ##ria to keep fish
really ? the aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850
the aquarium cr ##az ##e was launched in early victorian england
i like progressive rock a ton , i ' m a spa ##stic person so i like music that changes it up constantly , you may hear 100 different motifs in a progressive rock song vs a traditional rock song which may have 1 or 2
a motif is basically like an idea , so if i wanted to paint you a picture of an ocean so that you could interpret it as an ocean , i would paint it blue , blue would be the motif in that case
exactly , co ##hee ##d and cam ##bria is a pretty popular modern example of progressive rock , they are very good . dream theater is another example , they ' ve been making progressive music for 30 years
in the united kingdom , and the republic of ireland , the word " walking " is acceptable to describe " all forms " of walking
yeah hiking has been around for ever , the term bush ##walk ##ing is endemic to australia
a day hike refers to a hike that can be completed in a single day , those are my favorites although i do like camping
i am sure there is although i don ##t know it ha ##ha ##h , i think im going a day hike next weekend
yes , prefer to eat less car ##bs , but when i eat them i prefer them alone sauce instead of ke ##tch ##up , as they are usually served .
they can also be topped more heavily , as in po ##uti ##ne and chill ##i cheese fries . i also like them a lot with bern ##ais ##e sauce .
wow , that is al ##ot ! i sometimes prepare the baked variant not so much because it is lower in fat but because it is easier and less messy .
i like a good bloody mary because of all of the sa ##vor ##y spices and flavor ##ings added in . how about you ?
ah , and i ' m no fan of rum and coke ! my apologies to cuba , where the drink originated , it just doesn ' t do it for me . . .
that ' s certainly true . some people get very s ##nob ##bis ##h about certain alcoholic drinks - or coffee drinks too , what with all of the different coffee / milk / etc . combinations - that it just causes unnecessary disco ##rd .
yeah the special gifts from santa claus , also known as saint nicholas , kris k ##ring ##le , father christmas , or simply santa , is a legendary figure originating in western christian .
modern santa claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical saint nicholas ( a fourth - century greek bishop and gift - give ##r of myra ) , the british figure of father christmas
its just a christmas tradition . christmas day is a public holiday in many of the world ' s nations , is celebrated religious ##ly by a majority of christians , as well as culturally by many non - christians ,
yes , absolutely . it ' s a very subtle flavor that is rich at the same time , if that makes sense . the word vanilla comes from spanish " vain ##a " which means " little pod " .
apparently that is done by mace ##rating and per ##cola ##ting the vanilla pods . you put it in a solution of water and ethanol .
i ' ve never actually thought about vanilla in co ##us ##cous . they ' re steamed balls of crushed du ##rum wheat se ##mo ##lina . it is usually served with stew . do they add the stew and vanilla ?
that sounds delicious . i didn ' t realize it , but co ##us ##cous is eaten throughout most of north africa .
that is terrible apple pie is so tar ##t
well i mainly make pe ##can because it is so delicious and usually includes vanilla , and salt to balance the taste
yes lots of it , and it is usually served with whipped cream and ice cream
pe ##cans are native to the southern us
vanilla is my favorite , and made from milk and cream , as is usually done .
really , that has never been one of my favorites . and do you prefer it sweet ##ened with sugar or sugar substitutes ?
i am not sure , but to prepare it you mix the ingredients and stir it to incorporate air and cool it below the freezing point .
like i told you before and that results in the smooth , semi - solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures
yeah i ' m really concerned with such a wide skill level of parents , i really want to be referred to as a good parent .
yeah i am even more concerned even if i do everything right how can i protect them from the harm government and society may have on them .
i am concerned for the future , my child was an abandoned child who i adopted , she is only 7 now but some day i will have to tell her even though she isn ' t my blood we are still family .
well i hope it all works out when you consider the alternative of ending up in an orphanage or foster care i think she will have a much better life .
nearly 90 % of people report feeling a form of social anxiety at some point in there lives . i find that mediation helped a lot since it helps you look at like through a different perspective
all participants in mediation are encouraged to participate in the process . i found that mind ##fulness meditation is really good . the idea isn ' t to have a blank mind but to watch your thoughts as a watch ##er not attached to them
it definitely will . keep in mind that social anxiety is a normal and necessary emotion for social functioning and developmental growth . also eating healthy and having exercise often will help
it is the subjective ##ly unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events , such as the feeling of death approaching .
it is released by blizzard entertainment .
they started on february 8 , 1991 using the name silicon and syn ##ap ##se .
some of their first games were rock n roll racing and the lost vikings .
how did you not like rock n roll racing ? it featured a number of popular heavy metal and rock songs in its soundtrack .
of course ! its comes from the ca ##cao bean in me ##so ##ame ##rica .
me ##so ##ame ##rica is between mexico and south america . also known as central america .
yes , in me ##so ##ame ##rica they have been cult ##ivating the ca ##cao bean for a very long time .

west ##world is a great tv show ! mick jagger is the lead singer and one of the founder members of the rolling stones .

lo ##l i ' ve never seen it . is it with house band the roots ?
definitely - if you want the heavy duty trucks , the ford f - series super duty is the one you would like to buy . it has a heavier - duty body ##work to ensure that it can work in any tough conditions . are you looking to buy a car ?
while that is a good idea - sometimes a truck can provide you more benefits that a smaller compact car just can ' t . you should look into the most popular version of the f - series , f - 150 .
yep - and that ' s why the f - 150 would be best for you . it is a smaller truck and more gas efficient but still gives you the power of a truck for towing capacity . i would not recommend the other trucks ( f - 250 through f - 550 ) .
progressive lenses are more used if you have pre ##sby ##op ##ia or accommodation errors

yes , there ' s something great about that soft cream cheese and a bottom layer of graham crack ##ers . an original , no fr ##ill ##s cheese ##cake !
an interior designer is someone who plans , researches , coordinates and i am really bad at all those things

atlantic city combines the best of beaches and las vegas . sun ##bat ##hing and black ##jack !
it inspired the board game monopoly ! the street names are the same .
erosion can be a big problem . they usually have to dr ##edge up sand to build up beaches at the start of the season .
they have to do it every years because it doesn ' t stop erosion , it just counter ##act ##s it .
i like green as well . have you ever heard about color psychology ? it ' s a study of hue ##s as a deter ##mina ##nt of human behavior

i was being curious to learn from someone who is good at swimming . i will try to swim using a ball to float until am able to
i am not sure but i am aware it is done as a sport in schools and collegiate as a sport
what i mean is that i am a choreographer and i practice the art of choreography
now you got is so right . choreography is basically applicable to human movement and form . it is a kind of performing art
yes , you are right . it is a type of writing called dance - writing and it is derived from the greek words " χ ##ο ##ρ ##ε ##ια " ( circular dance , see cho ##re ##ia ) and " γ ##ρ ##α ##φ ##η " ( writing ) .
sometimes i follow the history of choreography . it first appeared in the american english dictionary in the 1950s

i know several good trails . one of them is the superior hiking trail ( 310 - mile ) it ' s in northeastern minnesota that follows the overlooking lake superior
depends on my mood and how i feel . one time i went on this long appalachian national scenic trail and it was awesome ! i ' ve seen some wild animals
if you go on a short day hike ( which is completed in one day ) you don ' t really need much , just comfortable shoes and clothes and water
also you probably need some other hiking equipment like bug spray , suns ##creen and maybe some banda ##ids
i totally agree . most people just don ' t realize that being a parent goes beyond the biological aspects of it , and there is much more to raising a child than that . there are always critics !
me either ! not to mention that beyond the social media , there is even the government and society that tries to add their two sense to your parenting decisions .
we did too ! we went outside . i feel sorry for children without parents , living in foster care , that ' s very sad .
well it helps to have family to help too
have you ever had a fish steak , ground meat steak or pork steak ?

i am or lets say used to be , i haven ##t swam in a while
paris , is a city in france , officially the french republic ( , ) , is a country whose territory consists of metropolitan france in western europe , as well as several overseas regions and territories .

same process and rules , yeah . have to get your learn ##er ' s permit first , after a written test , and traffic / road rules tests .
absolutely , but at the cost of sitting through horribly old 70s instructional videos on vhs tape . . .
me too . especially the direct heat grill ##s , those can expose food to temperatures often in excess of 300 degrees which cooks the food faster . .
there is this thing called the the mail ##lard reaction that only occurs when foods reach temperatures in excess of 250 degrees . its what gives food the special grill taste .
no problem , also know that grille ##d meat acquire ##s that distinctive grille ##d roast aroma and flavor from the mail ##lard reaction as well .
well , and i should ask if it ' s the series of books or the british television series ! the latter ran on itv from january 1989 to november 2013 . quite the run !
a very long time ! 13 seasons and 70 episodes in total , each one adapted from a novel or short story by christie . i ' m not sure about awards . . . . but people must have loved it !

it is sad that mile ##y and other actors feel that have to use sexually explicit behavior to get the attention of higher up executives in the fields and move their careers up
it ' s to bad her father billy ray couldn ' t have had more of an influence on her b / c they always seemed like they were close

its considered to be closer to wild cabbage , though i know that ##s hard to believe because when i look at ka ##le i see spin ##ach ha ##ha . ka ##le aus ##ed to be one of the most common green vegetables in europe a long time ago believe it or not
well we currently eat ka ##le today now . they ##re available in just about all grocery stores . and at one point it was also used as a medicinal food source .
bow ##el ai ##lm ##ents . i can see that honestly . greens can lead to a happier health ##ier life !
i want to say europe but im not sure . that would be my best guess based on the fact that it was really common there . but ka ##le was brought to north america inn the 16th century : )
i have trouble with all colors - apparently it ' s an inherited fault in the development of one or more of the of color sensing cones in the eye .
i haven ' t checked them out yet , but i will ! i also have decreased visual ac ##uity and am uncomfortable in bright environments .
i do my best to cope ! yes , it ' s more common in males because genes responsible for the most common forms of color blindness are on the x chromosome .
i keep hoping for a cure , but sadly , there is no cure for this !
it ' s weird rum is a clear liquid . you ' d think being aged in oak barrels it would changed the color
whisky that is made from fe ##rm ##ented grain mas ##h is dark i think . may be wrong though , more of a drink ##er than a think ##er with it
it became popular shortly after 1900 ' s . when coca cola was first imported for cuba to the us
to the beach usually . what about you ? where do you like to go ?
probably her ##mos ##a beach in california because i have family there who i haven ' t seen in a long time .
i am on the east coast of the united states so it ' s all the way across the country . it ' s kind of expensive but the biggest issue is that it is time consuming to get there and i just can ' t go right now .

finance can also be defined as the science of money management , so it can also be about how you can manage your own money !
i think education is the biggest factor if we want to change the way this epidemic is playing out . it would be wise to start out telling people how much extra this disease is costing them , on average american spend approximately 1400 $ a year on obesity related ai ##lm ##ents .
kids are most susceptible to obesity . kids in the us have the highest rates of obesity worldwide , educating them while they are young is key to beating this .
its not only kids that have to be concerned about obesity . in 2008 64 % of adults have been reported as obe ##se .

oh ye ##a you are correct , the fiddle is informal violin , i meant viola .
since its a slightly more complex string instrument , the violin has only been around for about 400 years but that ##s still a long time .
most violins have a hollow wooden body to use as an amplifier , they are cool little instruments .
i imagine the wood quality is quite important in a violin / fiddle but i think bow quality might be as important or more so
definitely . everyone like pork . it is one of the most commonly consumed meat ##s in the world .
of course yes , i know that . which process do you adopt when making your steak . do you rather grill it or pan - fried , or bro ##iled .

they ' re cool dogs , aka " american gentleman "
an over - the counter headache pain relieve ##r !
my neighbor knew i would get a headache from hearing a 6 year old beat on the drums ! at least it wasn ' t an electronic drum set !

just look into or call salon ##s and ask about organic hair color . many will have natural hair ##color which isn ' t the same thing . they have been able to change the word " natural " to encompass so much more than what is truly natural . some can ruin the protein fi ##lam ##ent that grows the f ##oll ##icles .
it really is . now organic is the only thing i trust and i still have to look into it . of course you can have your hair professionally done but they have some great organic , chemical free brands that ship a special formula right to your house if you don ' t get highlights or anything special .

experiments have been conducted on auto ##mat ##ing cars since at least the 1920s ; promising trials took place in the 1950s and work has proceeded so far
it is really good to know that autonomous cars must have control systems that are capable of analyzing sensory data to distinguish between different cars .
also , it is interesting to understand this . big data is data sets that are so vol ##umi ##nous and complex that traditional data processing application software are inadequate to deal with them , it is a big thing these days
of course in due course of time , things change - the term " big data " tends to refer to the use of predict ##ive analytics , user behavior analytics , or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data , and seldom to a particular size of data set and it is changing forever .

the data regarding beaches also includes certain areas some may not even consider beaches because they are so small while most are larger geological units .
right , because most would think beaches consist of water influenced by tides would be creating it . when that isn ' t necessarily the case . when you think of it that way , if you have a pond and a little sandy edge you have a beach !

the piano was invented in italy by bart ##olo ##meo cr ##isto ##for ##i around the year 1700 . that was very early on !

i can imagine . what ' s interesting is that while most kids are adopted by couples , an individual can adopt under certain circumstances and if the child is at least 14 years younger

i would say that ' s probably true for those in the foster care system . adoption tends to bring more stability though since the child will be there permanently .

he certainly has quite the arm , and such skill it ' s no wonder he became the youngest super bowl - winning quarterback in only his second season at age 23 .

aw ##w that ##s great , iv ##e seen some shelters that even have sick tropical animals believe it or not . like parrot ##s and monkeys .

well it is tough ##t to specify just how many people would consider themselves hindu . hindu can mean several things , such as just af ##fi ##lia ##ting themselves culturally , ethnic ##ally , or lastly religious ##ly .
well in keeping with our theme , hinduism contains a broad range of phil ##oso ##phi ##es . there are many concepts , rituals and pi ##l ##gram ##ages that are shared amongst different thought processes .
well the term hind ##y in ##ital ##ly just described the people living in the indian sub ##ont ##inen ##t around the sindh ##u river . it wasn ' t until the 16th century though that the term began to refer to people who weren ' t turkic or muslims .
well , there are many int ##rica ##cies to raising a child . people have different ideas on what is right and what is wrong .
you always want to breast ##fe ##ed if possible . it has a lot of benefits to both mother and baby , which formula lacks .
i know the general recommendation is six months , but you can exclusively breast ##fe ##ed longer if you ' d like . just another aspect of parenting that is totally up to you .

yes it is quite ruthless , apparently my mother ' s was caused due to an inherited genetic defect , which is how around 5 - 10 % of cancers happen .
fortunately some cancers can probably be prevented as some are caused by obesity , poor diet , and lack of physical activity , and of course smoking .
i agree , tobacco use causes almost one fifth of all cancer deaths . i ' ve never smoked , but i ' m sure the nico ##tine addiction is a hard one to break .
definitely , and there are mu ##lit ##ple different methods to try if one does not work . it ' s crazy to think that tobacco smoke has over fifty chemicals that can cause cancer , 50 .
although i ' m sure some people speak other languages there , it says that english and spanish are the official languages

the steel city is pittsburgh ' s nickname due to its once bust ##ling steel industry . the city is also one of many bridges , 44 ##6 bridges as of today !

yeah , his show " the joy of painting " was on pbs from 1983 to 1994 . i liked to watch it a lot .
funny you mention that . he gained a lot of popularity on youtube after his death . nice to see a new generation appreciate his work .
poor family to go through that . bob has a half - brother named jim , who he mentioned on his show .
he actually lost part of his left index finger from a carpenter accident .
that ##s adorable , its crazy to think that the quality of parenting can be even more essential than the quantity of time spent with the child . pretty wild .
in our society many different orphaned or abandoned children receive parental care from non - parent blood relations .
adoption is great but in general the prospective adoptive parents must meet all the legal adoption requirements of their country of residence and those of the country whose nationality the child holds .
sure do , in the us you have to be a legal age of 25 years in order to adopt a child .
great ! i like the water marble nail it is so awesome , it involves dropping nail colors in water and creating different patterns , which is transferred to my nails .
it actually isn ' t that much work . it helps to remove the cut ##icle skin and soft ##en them as well so to help my nails out .
the nail art is not a lot of work . nail art is similar to a mani ##cure and pe ##dic ##ure they are also beauty treatments .
the best benefit to it would be for health benefits honestly , for the health ##iness of the cut ##icles and skin .
that is true . pets are very valuable in that they provide emotional benefits and even help physically .
yes they do . they are particularly helpful to the elderly who don ' t get out much and to those that live alone .
indeed , i have seen many therapy animals and they help kids out so much and even the elderly . it does them good to be around them .
me too . this notion is popular among those who are involved with the christian doctrine of trinity as far i can recall
well , the christian theology which makes the set of beliefs and practice for christians is about 2 , 000 years old
well , actually there is no established guidelines specific to these principles but with some concrete induction we may come the same conclusion too indeed
notions are like those random wire antennas . they are either straight or they may be strung back and forth between different conclusions
yeah the original ford mustang was manufactured in 1962 ! it was a two - seater concept car .

sure ! it ' s interesting that the concept of extreme coup ##one ##rs was first mentioned by the wall street ju ##orn ##al in 2010
i think most of the my little pony franchise characters take equal turns in the spotlight based on their unique characteristics .
based on research , the po ##nies each had unique symbols representing their unique characteristics . they promoted embracing differences .
the first my little pony toys were produced in 1981 , but after a poor introduction , they redesigned and relaunched the line the following year to much greater success .
i agree . it is rare to find a children ' s toy that embrace ##s differences and doesn ' t promote un ##real ##istic body images or behaviors . and , there are even male enthusiasts who call themselves " my little bro ##nies " !
no , do you ride a du ##lc ##ati single cylinder motorcycle ?
it was a z ##l 650 . i also had an old 4 stroke engine honda that was a blast to trail ride . e

they also added salad ##s to the menu as well as fish , smooth ##ies and fruit .
i think they are four in number , the majority of their career , the group consisted of michael " mike d " diamond ( vocals , drums ) , adam " mca " ya ##uch ( vocals , bass ) and adam " ad - rock " ho ##rov ##itz
a lot , the beast ##ie boys have sold 26 million records in the united states and 50 million records worldwide

apparently the papa john ' s headquarters are in kentucky , but i had friends who were the founder ' s neighbors in st . louis .
they said he was a jerk . but he is a self - made man . he sold his cam ##aro in 1984 to buy his first pizza equipment and sold pizza ##s out of a closet in a tavern .
right ? ! i can see having to put up a facade like that in order to do business at that level .
i don ##t really know to be honest but i do know that being a goalkeeper is the most specialised position in the sport .
the goalkeeper ' s primary role is to prevent the opposing team from successfully moving the ball over the defended goal - line wi ##ch is very important .
yes goal ##ies get individual training from the rest of the team
ye ##a and it has a lot of culture being it was on of the 13 original colonies as a british colony .
ye ##a it started as a colony back in 1733 so its nearly 300 years old .
it should have a lot of civil war history as it was the last state to be restored into the union in the aftermath .
ye ##a nowadays they are only really known for their huge airport hub in their capital city , atlanta
it is basically a super - sweet cu ##star ##d pie , with an egg , butter , and sugar base . it is too sweet for me .
i ' m not sure when the pie was first developed , but i know that native americans were eating pe ##cans more than 8 , 000 years ago .
supposedly the pie was first put together by the french , soon after the settling of new orleans . so , it has been around a long time , either way .
same ! i avoid any type of skyscraper ##s at all costs . i can ' t believe there are actually people out there who have a head for heights .
oh god , right ? ! i could never ! i know the cord stretches and recoil ##s when you jump , but what if it snaps ?
i guess it ' s all about finding a trust ##worthy source to experience it , but i don ' t know , i don ' t think i could do it . the idea of free - falling is not thrilling to me .
beef stew is great ! carrot ##s come in a variety of color such as orange , purple , black , red , white , and yellow
yes , they are all different sizes as well . they are native to europe and southwestern asia
yes that is really neat ! also the most commonly eaten part of a carrot is called the tap ##ro ##ot , although some people actually eat the greens as well .
the myth that carrot ##s are good for vision was brought on by the british in world war ii to mis ##lea ##d the enemy about their military capabilities . isn ' t that pretty neat ?
yeah my nephew loves it too . he spends half the day playing it . the part about building stuff allows players to build with cube ##s in a 3d environment .
there ' s a bunch of different mode to play in . there ' s a survival mode , a creative mode where you can fly , and an adventure mode where you can play maps designed by others . then there ' s a spectator mode where the laws of physics don ' t exist ha ##ha .

fly fishing itself is an ang ##ling method in which you do put an artificial " fly " on the end to catch fish with .
they do that to im ##itate a fly flying over the water , and trying to also im ##itate a injured fly so the fish are more attracted to it .
any kind really , i usually fly fish for trout but it can be done in fresh or salt water , so it doesn ##t matter , you can catch almost any kind of fish on the line .
no not really just as long as you are casting a nearly weight ##less fly lure and not a heavy one . its all about the casting techniques that significantly different from other forms of casting and to not tire your arms out too fast .

his name is rodney , my mother named him . that ' s great that you say she is gentle . i actually had to take a class with cesar mill ##an , the dog whisper ##er , most known for his reality tv series , because rodney was a bit of an aggressive pup at first .
he did well . he is much better now . it was a classical conditioning style class .

domino ##s - it ' s a popular chain here in canada - they sell pizza either whole or in portions - but i always buy a whole pizza and eat it all myself !
fen ##nel , hot sauce , italian spices to name a few . interesting ##ly , naples is where the modern pizza was invented !
my hair is brown , apparently the darker the hair color , the more individual f ##oll ##icles a person has on their scalp .
i didn ' t know that . . . i wonder if it was natural , or if they used hair dye to color it . nowadays , hair coloring is so popular . have you ever colored your hair ?
om ##g ! that would be terrible ! lo ##l i have colored my hair quite a few times . i ' ve had it done professionally and had my mom do it at home . one time it turned purple . did you have yours done professionally or at home ?

i like pokemon gold and silver .
they came out in 1999 in japan but 2000 in north america .

there actually aren ' t any records of their exact origins or date of introduction into the united states , so it ' s hard to say .
they are , they ' ve even been said to be " native " to the state of maine . they ' re the official state cat .
they very well may prefer cooler temperatures with their prominent " ru ##ff " of fur along the chest and uneven two - layered coat and bush ##y tail .
they are gorgeous , indeed . they come in a wide range of colors . for showing , the only disqualified colors are lila ##c and chocolate .
i like the shade th ##st is close to violet . its still different at the same time because violet is a spectral color
a spectral color is a color that is enhanced by a human being by a single wavelength of light in the visible spectrum
the traditional colors are red , orange , yellow green and blue
green is a great color . it sits between blue and yellow
more formally some call la ##zine ##ss a di ##sin ##cl ##ination to activity or ex ##ert ##ion despite having the ability to act .
yes me too , particularly since some people used it as a pe ##jo ##rative as well as other terms like couch potato or slack ##er .
i don ' t think so , i believe la ##zine ##ss is more a habit rather than a mental state .
some think that it make reflect a lack of self - este ##mm or lack of positive recognition of other , personally i think it is over ##anal ##ys ##ing a simple thing .
yes , i would certainly say so , there is good nutrition in a banana and it will get you ready for the day ' s work !
make sure you get the things your body needs to perform optimal ##ly . you need car ##bs , proteins , fat ##s , minerals , vitamin ##s - not too much mind you .

well most european countries actually prevent the killing of healthy stray dogs .

well te \ hey make high performance cars , so they tend to be expensive

there is minnesota to the west , iowa to the southwest , illinois to the south , lake michigan to the east
yes it does , he state capital is madison , and its largest city is milwaukee
i ' m not sure but what i can tell you for now is that is divided into 72 counties .
wisconsin is second to michigan in the length of its great lakes coastline
the distance did not become standardized until 1921 for the marathon
in 1896 the marathon was one of the original modern olympic events
not sure about the spectators but there are over 800 marathon ##s run around the world each year
my favorite is kill ' em all that they released in 1982 under the independent record label mega ##force records .
ride the lightning was their second studio album , they released it in 1984
the album title was taken from a passage in stephen king ' s novel , " the stand "
i like mega ##de ##ath too , dave must ##aine was raised by je ##ho ##vah ' s witness of all things .
i agree . the concerns of economic cost , environmental impact and crime are straw men used to divide voters . there are no stats to back them up .
that ' s true , and considering the us had nearly open borders until 1924 , erect ##ing further barriers seems h ##yp ##oc ##rit ##ical ! when their parents benefited from open borders .
she came with her sister . i don ' t think people are coming to destroy the country . research exists that shows it as beneficial to both countries .
you can say that again . apparently , as many as 1 in 8 americans is an immigrant , with 1 in 9 having an immigrant parent . we are a nation of immigrants .
a sea is a body of saline water , partially or fully enclosed by land . it ' s generally a division of an ocean

yes , and many of them are in the atlantic ocean , which makes up 20 percent of the earth ' s surface
as in put turkey in place of beef or the other way around ? i know that the cows legs and neck are the tough ##est part
oh okay i see . im not fond of the ground version of the meat so i don ##t like ground turkey either lo ##l . i have never been to a butcher but i know that cuts of beef are in ##ital ##ly sep ##erated from the car ##cas ##s during the butcher ##ing
i will ! i read a book once about how they do it , they split it along the axis into halves and then into quarters . also , yes i do like regular turkey !
not too much , but he was apprentice to the great violin maker nico ##lo ama ##ti
the mandolin and its pl ##ect ##rum or pick playing inspired the piano .
that is difficult to say , but it came from the lu ##te family .
actually , meat ##lo ##af is a traditional german dish . smoking it is fairly simple . once you fix it up , instead of baking , you put it in your smoke ##r . it has such good flavor that way .
lo ##l . well the shape is merely the tradition . it is typically shaped like a loaf of bread , but it doesn ' t have to be . you can shape it any which way you choose .
well , the american meat ##lo ##af stems its traditions from the german idea , but americans mixed ground pork with corn ##me ##al . this started in pennsylvania in colonial times .
i have one car , a ford focus . i have lots of protection against physical d ##ma ##ages and liability coverage , but i have luckily never needed it
i am okay with it , but i put in enough money to buy a nice ##r car . i have an older focus . they started producing them in america in 1999 , i got mine not more than a few years after that
yes , but i wo ##uy ##ld just lie a newer focus i think , it has been relatively good to me so far !

yeah i am sure there will be a solution within the next couple hundred years . in the meantime i will prefer to only visit in the summer ##time ha ##ha ##a .
i think with flying vehicles things get very tricky . i do not believe so . but i do believe we will have very fast shuttle ##s . that can travel like 500 ##mp ##h .
i also like the wild beaches because they are undeveloped or und ##is ##co ##vered and are usually quite beautiful
they are great for their beauty and preserved nature , which is really quite lovely !
they may not be safe because they don ' t have resorts , camps , hotels or restaurants nearby
i like kim ##mel , but kim ##mel doesn ' t have the roots ! fallon is actually the 6th host of the tonight show .
hmm ##mm . . . an inn ##ova ##tor seems a bridge too far . he ' s clever . but then again , he was on the man show , too .
ah , you are referencing his tip - toe ##ing around trump ? i agree that kim ##mel seems to get into politics a bit more . but when you need a break from that . . . fallon is nice !
me too ! if there is no pink then purple it is ! it makes sense for me because i like both blue and red , and purple is a mix between both !
oh those sound really awesome ! i want some ha ##ha . purple is most associated with magic and royalty !
yes it does ! when it is in combination with pink , it is associated with seduction and fe ##mini ##nity !

the international english language testing system , or ie ##lts , is an international standard ##ised test of english language proficiency that seems to work pretty well .
i have heard from other trainer that there is tremendous controversy over various methods of horse training . is this true ?
that is terrible , but basic animal training concepts apply to all forms of training .
i think it is so cool that horses are trained to be manage ##able by humans for everyday care as well as for equestrian activities .
i have heard some dogs are , i guess now horses are geared toward making horses useful for a variety of recreational and sporting .
the concept of cartoons originated in the middle ages . it was first described as a painting , fresco , tapestry or stained glass window .
no , that didn ' t happen until the 19th century , when they would publish humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers .
i am not too sure about that , but , in the early 20th century , they started referring to them as comic strips .
apparently they were one of the founding big four bands of thrash metal along with mega ##de ##th , ant ##hra ##x and slayer
i think so , especially ant ##hra ##x , even though they were the only one of those big four from the east coast .
i ' m not sure , but they ' ve sold 2 . 5 million records in the us from 1991 - 2004 and 10 million worldwide so i guess some people like them .
i ' m not sure , but usually there isn ' t a specified cause looked for . it ' s mostly attributed to muscle or joint strain .
no medicine , just rest and maybe a hot bath on bad days . 40 = 90 % of people stop feeling lower back pain in a few weeks . we must not be that lucky ha ##ha .
luckily we are not alone . there is a possibility 95 % of americans will have back pain at some point in their life .
yeah , i would avoid surgery too . our lower back pain is the most common , since the lu ##mba ##r supports most of the upper body weight .
i know more about the history . indie rock origin ##iated in the united states and the united kingdom in the 1980s .
it ' s true , so did heavy metal . the thing about indie rock though is that it ' s started to get commercial success . is it even " indie " anymore ?
well for one it also originated in the uk in the 60s and 70s , but my favorite parts of it are the distortion and overall loud ##ness of the music .
the books were written between 1937 and 1949 , and have sold over 150 million copies . that ' s pretty amazing !
j . r . r . was actually a he . the lord of the rings was written as a sequel to " the ho ##bb ##it " , which was written in 1937 .
the story starts in the shire , where ho ##bb ##its are from . they have quite an adventure !
the english pediatric ##ian donald win ##nic ##ot has a theory of the concept of " good - enough " parenting in which a minimum of needs for the healthy development of a child are met .
win ##nic ##ot said that the good - enough mother starts of by completely taking care of her child ' s needs . as time progresses she adapt ##s less and less , gradually , and according to the child ' s ability to deal with her failure to provide .
child rear ##ing is the process of supporting the physical , emotional and intellectual development of the child from infancy onwards . i think he means it intuitive .
well , parenting refers to the int ##rica ##cies of raising a child . i think i would be hands - on until the child has learned something and then back off a bit when they are looking confident .
iced and hot and fra ##ppe ##s and now some foods also . it was founded in seattle , washington in 1971 .
mostly snacks and past ##ri es . as of no ve ##mber 201 6 , it operates 23 , 76 ##8 franchises worldwide
they use es ##press ##o machines a lot for different roast ##s since the 2000 ' s
the new one is kevin johnson , it was howard schultz
oh no , 9 is young , i hope that is not the norm . . . ours is so small , like between 2 and 10 pounds
we got her thinking she was a mix of a po ##odle and something , but disputed what it was , that was about 6 months ago now !
i am surprised po ##odle ##s are ranked the second most intelligent dog breed , because ours is sort ##a dumb to be honest
we have tried a bunch , and she only does them if she can smell food . which maybe that still is smart in a way i suppose ! she also does not use the bathroom very well
well , you ' ll have to pay attention to safety , first and foremost . a lot of factories make discrete products , or some type of material continuously produced , so things like chemicals , pulp and paper , or refined oil products . but , especially with chemicals , you need to make sure you follow regulations to a tee in order to maintain your health and safety . it ' s not just pre ##ca ##ution ##ary .
well , luckily for the workers , if you ' re at a factory that deals with chemicals - - which are usually called plants - - then most of the equipment used , like tanks / pressure vessels / chemical reactors / pumps & pip ##ing , is all operated from a control room , with the equipment being outdoors . so , there ' s some safety built in .
remember that chemical plants , if you do work in one , utilize specialized equipment , units , and technology all throughout their manufacturing process . so , you want to know what every single piece of equipment does and what every order of operation is , so that you know where you can mess up and how to avoid it , etc . just take your time to study every step , and you should be fine .
curry ! found in many indian dishes . it comes from the curry leaves .
nice ! i also like english cuisine . like bread ##s and different cheese ##s .
cool . that sounds like it would go well with some italian food .
do you use hooks made of wood or metal when you cr ##oche ##t ?
that makes sense . is the shaft easier to work with on a metal one ?
i know knitting involves multiple stitches on the needle at once , is cr ##oche ##t simpler ?
yes , since the beginning , alex tre ##bek has performed as host .
the original show aired on nbc in 1964 and aired until 1975 .
well , they moved to a nighttime syndicated show which aired from 1974 to 1975 and then a revival , " the all - new jeopardy "
i can ' t imagine ! as tre ##bek is signed as the host of jeopardy , it is difficult to imagine another host !
yes . some countries have a lot more culture that promotes vegetarian ##ism like india than others
yes . cattle are traditional considered end ##ear ##ed and respected in hinduism , sikh ##ism , jain ##ism , and buddhism

its so nos ##tal ##gic . bob ross ' s show " the joy of painting " originally aired from 1983 to 1994 . what a long run .
bob ross is really me ##sm ##eri ##zing . before it got on netflix , the influx of attention was because he got so popular on youtube .
bob ross was raised in orlando florida by his parents jack and ollie ross . i bet he had some great landscape to paint out there .
i always wonder if different countries follow the wedding cake custom
it would make sense . i think it ' s always good to start off a new chapter of life with a sweet begin ##ing .
i love the traditional wedding cake it ' s got a one of a kind taste i feel like . my wedding cake was traditional and fond ##ant with 3 layers you know the look .
it ' s that smooth looking frost ##ing that is smooth and kind of seam ##less . it makes the cake layers look like they belong together seam ##lessly .
and ##rogen ##ic hair is generally what beard ##s are classified under .
some people have less facial hair , and some groups have more facial hair than others .
indian , middle eastern , and european areas are known for beard ##s !

anything involving combat in the water . they can use surface ships or submarines , as well as a sl ##ew of other means to carry out combat .
yes , exactly ! what i find interesting is sometimes the navy works in deter ##ring nuclear attacks . they use missiles with their submarines .
i do . they are a register of the united kingdom .
i was 19 . it ' s very unfortunate that tattoos historically in the west were characterized as " un ##ci ##vili ##zed ' ?
no , it was a military tattoo so it has a lot of significance to me .
i ' m sure you would enjoy something that was meaningful to you , maybe something symbolic or per ##tine ##nt to you .
it became available worldwide in june 2015 . what will you be using the echo for if deciding to purchase one ?
so what made you just decide i want a echo ? some features i use my alexa for is music streaming , alarms reminder ##s things like that .
no it is more of a smart speaker with amazon where a to amazon prime is a membership for shipping from amazon .
with the echo no your privacy is well covered privacy issues is only a concern when you are protecting your information through social media etc the echo is strictly a speaker voice assistant .
i hear lake champ ##lain makes up half of vermont ##s border
dude the great lakes consists of lake superior , michigan , huron , erie and many more

it is actually the longest linear park and runs through 29 counties in both virgin ##a and north carolina ! isn ' t that crazy ?
can ' t blame you for confusing it with the appalachian ##s . the parkway runs along the spine of blue ridge , which is a part of the appalachian ##s .
i love to explore all mountainous regions , but blue ridge is my favorite because they are noted for having a blu ##ish color when seen from a distance , which is pretty cool .
yes , the acoustic ##s are great . i think the hard walls in the bathroom create an atmosphere that anyone ' s voice sounds good .
yes , the car does not have all the smooth and hard surfaces in it . therefore it can not create the same sound as the bathroom . the bathroom produces different sound waves and makes you sound good .
some people actually had tiles installed in their studio to rec ##reate the bathroom effect on their vocals .
yes , weird al yank ##ovic created his first hit called my bologna in a bathroom .
when i was in school there was a competition called the 100 - metre dash , its basically a sprint race in track and field competitions . its very tough .
i think they are all the same length , but i know that the world championships 100 metres has been doubted since 1983 .
yep it sure is sprinter ##s in the olympics usually reach top speed after somewhere between 50 – 60 meters . their speed slow ##s down a lot towards the finish line .
vegetarian ##ism is where you don ' t eat any meat or seafood . some people still eat dairy but some do not

yeah the word translates from spanish to the little armoured one and we bb ##q them here
no i live in the south but in europe they have similar names
genetic research shows an extinct giant version existed , we use tony cache ##res to season them
some animals make a skill out of it . they sometimes ho ##ard much food !
birds are very aggressive when it comes to ho ##arding . they collect a lot of items even as pets .
mag ##pies are incredibly well known for ho ##arding things .
the avengers infinity war was so good . what a cliff hang ##er . blows my mind that the avengers made their comic debut way back in 1963 .
the avengers franchise is that old . they were created by none other than stan lee and jack kirby . their first appearance was in avenge ##r # 1 .
very famous com ##in book writers and creators . it wasn ' t until avengers # 4 that captain american joined the team . they found him trapped in ice and then revived by the group .
they are so complex . i love them too . when the first avengers movie came out , it set a bunch of records . it is still one of the biggest opening weekends in north america .
there are two species of " i ##gua ##na " the green i ##gua ##na and the lesser anti ##lla ##ean i ##gua ##na
i read they can range in length including their tail . about how long was yours ?
i read that they have a third eye on their heads
i also read they have a row of spines running down their backs
i know a lot about it , strangely . there ' s a fischer - scale that ranges from a to o , light blonde to dark blonde . mine is an a shade .
the term blonde was first used in 148 ##1 from old french " blu ##nd "
i think so . people tend to be attracted to my blonde hair , though originally blonde was just referring to fairness .
i think in this case , fair means light . they used to call it " f ##æ ##ger - fe ##ah ##s " .
yu ##p and they also do x ##ray , ultrasound , pet , and mri scans . these are all imaging techniques they use to tr ##rea ##t and dia ##gno ##se diseases . ct stands for computed tom ##ography .
sometimes a reporting radio ##grapher which is a radio ##grapher with advance training , can interpret basic images which usually a diagnostic radio ##logist does
mri stands for magnetic resonance imaging and nm ##r stands for nuclear magnetic resonance , which is when nuclei in a magnetic field absorb and re emi ##t electromagnetic radiation . they have a lot in common but im not exactly sure how similar they are , if i had to guess i would say nm ##r is a type of mri
oh okay sorry about that . im not 100 % on mri ##s in detail but i can tell you intervention ##al ra ##di ##logy is the performance of medical procedures with the guidance of imaging technologies . radio ##logy improves our lives greatly .
i personally like ja ##la ##pen ##os it can be topped with other vegetables and meat ##s and can also be made without cheese .
i have never made my own but many independent and chain restaurants offer pizza on their menu ##s .
yes pizza delivery is even available in some parts of the world .
good burger is a 1997 comedy film directed by brian robbins .
the movie didn ' t but the highest grossing film teenage mutant ninja turtles made 49 ##3 . 3 million worldwide .

i love their long coat . it keeps them warm in the winter time . i like to go on long hike ##s and mine has no trouble staying out for a long time .
i agree ! they ' re perfect pets for suburban areas or in the country . they ' re probably the nice ##st breed .
the only downs ##ide i can think of is that they shed so much . it ' s insane . usually when the season is changing . i have to groom him all the time .
oh that always looks scary ! i read that the breed was once known as the als ##ati ##an in britain and ireland
also apparently the german shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog with their org ##in dating back to 1899
i ' m not sure either . they were originally developed to herd sheep so that is why they are a part of the herd ##ing group
yes , now they are used for all types of work including disability , search and rescue , police work , military work , and even acting
well , that depends . survival ##ist camp ##ers just bring essential ##s whilst recreational camp ##ers sometimes bring their own power and furniture .
generally participants leave developed areas to camp in the fall or spring when its cooler .
i would recommend you go with a friend or youth organizations . it can be dangerous to go alone .
yep camping will teach you both about self - reliance and team ##work .
sometimes as well when you add other ingredients such as garlic or chi ##ves makes it even better
i like spicy cheese like pepper ##jack . al ##ot of people around here also " cold smoke " cheese and that is really good as well
the pe ##llet smoke ##rs that you can get . they get " smoke tubes " and add flavor ##ing to the cheese that way . very delicious .
i " m not sure if you can buy in store . but the flavors used could be hickory , me ##s ##qui ##te or even apple or cherry
yes ! european fu ##t ##bol is something i love to watch ! especially from spain !
ye ##a ! ronald ##o is one of the greatest players of all time , but he just got popped for tax eva ##sion !
tax eva ##sion is essentially where you don ' t pay the taxes that you should , often by sliding numbers around .
i believe he is , but ronald ##o is so famous i think he kinda just paid it and got out . i saw it on the news in the usa . he was in his peak in the 90s
i agree i have always wanted to go there too . boston is actually new england ' s largest city .
yes new england history is fascinating . small early attempts at colonies actually disappeared .
where else besides boston would you want to go ?
i only watch the nhl . its considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world .
the nhl only plays in the usa and canada .
no , but at its inception , the nhl only had 4 teams !
my favorite is the boston bruins , they joined the league in 1924 .
the group names are john lennon , paul mccartney , george harrison and ringo starr , they became widely regarded as the foremost , they were really big !
rooted in ski ##ffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , the beatles later experimented with several musical styles ,
also , in 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as " beat ##lem ##ania " ; as the group ' s music grew in so ##phi ##stic ##ation , led by primary songwriters lennon and mccartney
yeah . mental health is more about a subjective well - being , and competence , and one ' s intellectual / emotional potential according to the who .
i know there ' s a spanish thriller of the name , " te ##sis " , but is this the same as thesis ? perhaps in spanish ?
have you seen that movie , te ##sis , it stared ana torre ##nt ?
i believe alejandro am ##ena ##bar won 9 go ##yas total , and even an actual oscar .
i think you are probably right , but i don ' t have the statistics on hand . i do know that the silver ##ado is the mechanically identical cousin of the gm ##c sierra , though .
the tun ##dra is certainly a distinguished car as well , having won motor trend mag ##azi ##n ' es truck of the year in both 2008 and 2000 .
lex ##us are certainly a high quality brand as far as i ' m aware too , even though it didn ' t exist as a brand in its home market until 2005 strangely enough .
along with long books , he has also written around 200 short stories , most of which has been collected in book collections .

yes , he is one experienced writer for sure . he has published over 54 acclaimed novels , including seven under the pen name richard bach ##man !
the col ##oss ##eum and the vatican museums come to mind . i would like to visit myself .
i wouldn ' t be surprised if it had it ' s own block of zip ##codes , as it is an independent city state , sovereign from the rest of rome .
me either , but it would be interesting to see . i think there are over 4 million tourists per year - 39th most visited in the world .
well italy is known for it ' s food , and rome in particular being one of the most important tourist destinations would have an excellent selection of pasta , pizza , and the like .
with occupation dating back over 5000 ##0 years ago there are lots of people who were born and immigrated there .
true ! because the island makes it difficult to get food from other countries , they picked up whale hunting in the 12th century .

japan is really well known for the advances made in technology . especially gaming and telephone ##s .

he got that hall of fame back in april 1983 a while ago he is a legend .
he was born november 27th 1942 in seattle , washington a great man and guitarist .
i ' ve heard that too , though that ' s probably the case only with certain species , of which there are at least 21 extant .
wow , that ' s dedication ! where in central florida ? i ' ve spent more time in south florida , since my in - laws live there .
that ' s east of tampa , right ? i bet that teacher got in trouble with the administrators .
it is usually made on a manufacturing scale anywhere to heavy levels to cottage levels .

deer ##skin can be used for work gloves or price ##y apparel .
agreed . the characters that make up japan ' s name mean " sun origin " .
no , i don ' t sorry . japan is divided into 47 prefecture ##s in eight regions .
the regions each have a governor . hokkaido is the northernmost and okinawa the southernmost .
yeah , it ' s where the us launched their land attack on april 1 , 1945 .
there are 1 . 3 million species of insects , so there is a lot for him to study if he chooses to .
and it also overlap ##s with a lot of other topics like genetics , biochemistry , ecology , biology , and even pale ##ont ##ology - he may need a graduate degree to be able to work in this field .
yes , even just modern biology is an incredibly vast field - my daughter wants to be a vet and it ' s astronomical how many classes it involves .
yes , she ' s looking at 8 full years of school plus state board licensing exams .
' co ##s i ' m a trades ##man , i studied the principles of electricity , often electro ##static generators of one form .
it takes training and skills to perfect my act , also i special ##ize in wiring ships , airplanes , and other mobile platforms , as well as data and cable .
electro ##cute ##d ? lo ##l ! safety first my friend . we also have the line ##men , who work on electric utility company distribution systems at higher voltage ##s , and wire ##men .

a fictional ##ized account of the sinking of the rms titanic
to answer you second question . it was starred by leonardo di ##cap ##rio and kate wins ##let
there have been multiple spin ##offs from it , including " top chef masters " and " top chef junior "
i was surprised when i found out that it was produced by the same company that created " project runway "
yes i think it would be really fun !
i may write a book with a friend and in that case we would be joint authors
if i write a book i would need to do a copyright that protects the authors original works
right and if i get a copyright on my writings anyone wanting to use them must have permission so that would be good
for a musica ##n that was discovered for his awesome youtube videos and signed i think he must be good
2008 . his first album after being signed on " my world " had seven songs that got to the billboard chart hot 100 songs .
yes , i am sure you are familiar with " under the mist ##let ##oe " which was available november 2011 . it got to number 1 when it was released in 2011
i really enjoyed it but was never too good at it , the term " surfing " refers to the act of riding a wave
i really like the surf culture tho , that initial culture directly influenced modern surfing , which began to flourish and evolve in the early 20th century
another prominent form of surfing is body boarding have you heard about it ?
yeah they do , it has really been around for a long time . it was established in 1935 .
there are a lot of teams in the league ! in 1935 switzerland was chosen as the host country for the championship .
i don ' t think it is currently on anymore honestly , in 1935 it was switzerland and ten other countries .
i don ' t have any information on that , during the 50 ##s though the soviet union won 4 out of the 5 championships !
well then you should definitely never go anywhere near mount everest . it is the highest mountain above sea level .
yeah a lot of people die on mount everest . david sharp who was a mountain ##eer dies in 2006 while on the mountain . it was pretty controversial .
nope , i definitely don ' t want to die . i like boulder ##ing but no extreme climbs for me .
well , bea ##gles are known for their good temper , and lack of inherited health problems . so that could be why he ' s chu ##bby : ) .
i think they are mostly those colors because of the hound traits in them . they are quite good at picking up scents and it used primarily for hunting hare ##s !
bea ##gle type dogs have existed for close to 2500 years , but the most modern breed was developed in great brit ##ian around the 1830 ' s .
well , you should start by getting it diagnosed by a mental health professional

you have to split open the bean and scrape out its insides . additionally , when growing poll ##ination is required to get the fruit which creates the flavor ##ing .
there are three major types most are grown in mexico .
they are typically published as a book these days , but i guess back then it could even have just been story - telling .
and of course there is a novella which is a bit shorter than a novel but longer than a short - story .
then of course there are novels like mob ##y - dick . that is way too long of a novel for me - my da ##ugh ##er had to read that last year for her english class .
they say melville ##s work was pretty much forgotten during his last 30 years - my da ##ugh ##er said the book spent 1 / 2 of the time just talking about the setting - that is way ##y ##y too boring .
sometimes when reading about parental child abduction ##s , i become worried about becoming one in the future
the fear itself that induce ##s some form of perceived danger is a very discomfort ##ing state of the mind . i want my child to be very safe
indeed . in christian theology , children are meant to be protected by parents , and in return parents are expected to be treated with high respect
bank teller ##s have to at least acquire a high school diploma and have experience with cash .
they do have to be able to stop and detect any signs of fraud from customers .

bank teller ##s do require a lot of friendly interactions , a skill many people should learn .
have you been diagnosed with any anxiety disorders besides social anxiety ? i have panic disorder .

public speaking is the worst ! with your stu ##ttering , do you notice if you repeat certain sounds or letters more than others ?
i wish i was able to see star wars in 1977 when it came out .
i prefer the film that stars mark ham ##ill and harrison ford .
cool . did you ever see the empire strikes back in 1980 ?
it is set three years after the original star wars .

ye ##a the ferrari f ##40 was one of the fastest cars in its day and cost $ 400 , 000 in 1987
i don ##t know about that but i do know jaguar x ##j ##22 ##0 was the fastest car in 1992 and 1993
i believe that a lot of this issue stems from income inequality . most of the poor are the working poor . you shouldn ' t work full time and not be able to afford the nec ##ess ##ities .
the income gap is growing the bottom 50 % of families average a net worth of $ 11 , 000 while the top 1 % continue to rake in bigger profits . it ' s not sustainable .
i agree . i believe that the solution is to close the loop ##holes so that the very rich and mega corporations are paying their fair share . i ' ve seen corporations pay a 0 % tax rate .
i hope they do ! when it comes to animals , the mother ' s condition is most important . hopefully the border situation gets better
human touch is essential to mental health , i feel . it ' s common that orphans will grow out with one or either parent , which is very sad .
that ' s very sad to hear . some orphans are considered " half - orphan " if they lost a single parent
i did not know there was an age cut off . maybe 18 . orphans are rare ##r in developed countries
what do you then do with the " little armoured ones " ?
i couldn ' t imagine people eating those cute little " ta ##tu " . they look so adorable .
it ' s portuguese for arm ##adi ##llo which is from an even older language .
i completely agree with you as visual impaired people have so many difficulties on normal daily tasks like driving and walking .
i know , i feel the same way . i wish there were more ta ##ct ##ile warning that can be detect ##able by long cane ##s to alert the visually impaired but some think they might be hazardous .
either that or give them , for free , a cy ##dal ##ion which is a navigation aid for people with visual impairment ##s . they work in tango - enabled devices .

i love non - dairy cream ##ers with hazel ##nut and vanilla , too .
i think i am lac ##tose into ##ler ##ant because i tend to get b ##lo ##ating or gas sometimes when i have dairy products .
really ? i have never heard of that before . my lac ##tose into ##ler ##ance can vary depending on how much milk is in a food i have before symptoms start .
i believe it started in the 1930s .
one of them is bon iv ##er .

i am not sure but yoga goes all the way back to vedic indian traditions .
the beast ##ie boys were a hip hop group from new york city . they were 3 white , jewish rappers who made it in the world of rap music . they ' re pretty legendary .
it ' s funny because the beast ##ie boys started out as a punk band but then turned to rap music . they had a great first album called " licensed to ill " but i always liked " paul ' s boutique " better .
well they toured with madonna in 1985 and then released license to ill and that album just exploded . they ' re the biggest selling rap group of all time .
i don ' t know but they ' ve sold 50 million records worldwide . not bad !
i love any types of books that are based on science fiction . what are your favorite book genres ?
ha ##ha yes i like science fiction because it usually avoids the supernatural , unlike the other related books of fantasy .

oh , yes . there ' s skate ##park ##s for freestyle b ##mx ##ers , ag ##ress ##ive skaters , and sc ##oot ##ers . although sc ##oot ##er parks came very recently
i don ' t , however , i do know that a crate sc ##oot ##er preceded skate ##boards . they were just a wooden crate attached to the nose of a board which formed handle ##bar ##s !
we ' ve used them for dogs too - - but of course they can special ##ize in all * sorts * of animals - - like companion animals , livestock , zoo animals , horses . . . . all of our furry friends we love so much .
that ' s a great question ! i also wonder if other countries demand * more * education - - for instance , in the uk , animal treatment * must * be performed by a registered vet and it ' s illegal for anyone who isn ' t registered to call themselves one or pre ##scribe treatment .
they do ! no idea of how many special ##ties , but i do know there are specialists in surgery , der ##mat ##ology , and internal medicine .

well vet ##s practice veterinary medicine and treat diseases for animals .
all animals really , they even treat disorders and injuries too .
