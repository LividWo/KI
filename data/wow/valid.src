though humans have hunted animals and eaten them since prehistoric times , i don ' t ! that ' s a good attitude . and we live in a time where it is even less important to eat meat .

s a lot scar ##ier for women though , i think , it can cause psychological distress . definitely . my sister was lost hair after she gave birth . going through that and hormone changes definitely caused distress .
shame in public or social events , this is called minority stress . that makes complete sense . she had to learn how to part her hair different ways . i wonder how many women go through this too .

to do yoga i also love to watch videos of yoga as well , its a good tool to learn many new positions and new ways to stretch . yeah it is really helpful ##lm with the tied must ##les
it is a manner of pronunciation to a particular individual , location or nation . honestly , i think i sound like i was born here lo ##l but i guess people can still hear a little bit of accent

language the art of surfing " he ##ʻ ##e ʻ ##ana " ( " he ##ʻ ##e " means " to surf " yes i was recently in hawaii an i saw that hanging on the wall in dukes restaurant
i saw that hanging on the wall in dukes restaurant the part of surfing that scares me is actually standing up on the board which the poly ##nesian ##s invented its hard especially when you talk about riding a wave

fall or being really high up , so i hate un ##st ##ur ##dy ladder ##s and i height sturdy airplanes i got you , i ' m not a huge fan of the ascent in an airplane either .

some even so trusted enough to become the " newspapers of record " which means their journalism is trusted enough to be consensus fact . wow , that is interesting , do investigative journalists earn a lot every year ?
year , definitely more that the aforementioned " newspapers of record " like the new york times and boston globe and such . that is not bad pay at all , do they require any special training or schooling ?
does make sense , the weather guy . . what is the terminology for them again ? i forgot they go to school to do that , it would be hard to learn all the words and phrases they use
earlier when i was younger . i have never taken it myself . i know it comes from japan . it originated there in the early 20th century . interesting . i had always thought it originated in china .

about it , chickens are such an important animal for both agriculture and human survival . that is true , i wonder how we managed to get them to grow in such numbers though , that is as ##tou ##nding

##lea ##ch it to make it blonde ? not really , i do not like b ##lea ##ching , i just used a regular hair dye and surprisingly it worked , just turned out a different shade than expected .
75 % of women in some cities like copenhagen use hair dye this sounds like a lot . it doesn ' t surprise me though , women like change , it ' s boring to always look the same .
9 billion in 2011 wow , well sometimes it ' s worth it to spend money on looks . even though dye ##ing hair can damage hair permanently . it ' s hard to get back to natural color .

number 7 ? i know it ' s obvious to say , but it ' s the number following 6 , and coming before the number 8 . well liking or not liking numbers i really have not thought about
not liking numbers i really have not thought about the hindus use to write the number 7 as a curved stroke that looked like an inverted upper ##case j . numbers in different font ##s are interesting to look at
is , and how it is different in other languages . eastern arabs made the 7 from a 6 . it kinda looks like an upper ##case v . i do not think i have seen numbers in arabic before

one of the most popular and copied in the world , but nothing like the original i like pizza also - it ' s probably my favorite dish - oh and las ##ag ##na - ok just all of it

worse , i would say . over ##ea ##ting so much food is because they aim stuff at children , tis really terrible yes , i agree . i think americans need to re ##thi ##nk their food choices .
need to re ##thi ##nk their food choices . over ##ea ##ting is something that needs to be controlled and stop kids from eating so much food i agree . i think that the school systems should get involved .
think that the school systems should get involved . ye ##a over ##ea ##ting was being tackled by obama and michelle to stop too much eating i agree . there were many initiatives in the last decade that helped .
i really love pasta . what about you ? yes i do . pasta is a staple food of int ##alia ##n cuisine . if i had to choose , i ' d say spaghetti is my favorite pasta .

a staple food in italy . if was first discussed in literature in 111 ##5 in sicily . it has too many car ##bs for a low cal diet , i think italy where it was first eaten right ?
' s pretty good and has more protein . no rice or rice flour either , coconut flour or almond flour only . i wonder how many pasta dishes there are , probably too many variations to count i suppose
count i suppose there ' s a lot definitely ! it depends on the region where its made , with different shapes and types being popular to a specific region . oh really i like all the shapes and types
all the shapes and types me too ! there are 310 specific ##s shapes of pasta with over 1300 different names documented . it ' s quite amazing ! oh actually that is way more then i even imagined .
well , i can ' t be the only one who ' s had this fantasy then . 115 ##4 is a long time ago . did they make it similar to how it is done in modern times ?
? fresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand , sometimes with the aid of simple machines interesting . what is the most popular form of pasta ? i would guess spaghetti , but i don ' t really know .
really know . yeah ! spa ##get ##ti is a long , thin , solid , cylindrical pasta well , we both know italy is famous for pasta . are there any other countries who make their own version ?
of the new world and the introduction of potatoes , tomatoes , bell peppers , maize and sugar bee ##t those ingredients must have really helped bring pasta to the next level . i wonder if sailors ate pasta .
brown hair brown hair is the second most common color in humans . is it really ? i know red hair is the least common , so is blond the most common ?
red hair is the least common , so is blond the most common ? black hair is the most common . oh well that ' s interesting . do you know the percentage of redhead ##s in the world ?
##s in the world ? red hair is somewhere between one and two percent of all humans . that is so low . i know redhead ##s have a weird reaction towards an ##esthesia which makes surgery more complicated .
that makes sense because red hair is actually due to a mutation in the mc ##1 ##r protein that may be associated with others . so i am assuming the protein involves how it breaks down the an ##esthesia ?

orleans i ' m a huge fan of jazz . do you enjoy jazz ? i do not listen to jazz frequently , but i would like to listen some more because i do think it ' s unique !
because i do think it ' s unique ! jazz truly is ' america ' s classical music ' . i have heard that before , it ' s definitely a music genre that many people can relate to .

genre with cool african - american roots which is what i love about it ! jazz is fantastic , although it seems to have fallen from popularity since the 50 ' s , where rock and roll took over .
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it developed into blues and rag ##time too . modern jazz appears to be more inspired by those evolution ##s than the original jazz that was prevalent in the 1920 ' s
american and european - american . another awesome thing is it ' s evolved into performance as well ! a personal favorite genre of mine is where jazz instruments were introduced back into rock and roll and became ska .
example , response vocals and poly ##rh ##yt ##hm ##s but of course all that evolved with time too . it seems like jazz is the bedrock for most modern american music , with bluegrass making up the rest .

' s interesting , animals in sport are considered working animals . i would be fun , but now i ' m worried it ' s not good for the horse since it ' s considered work for them .
considered work for them . i see what you mean . some working animals are called draft animals or beats of burden . i don ' t like the sound of beats of burden . what does that mean ?
. it basically means animals trained to provide a tract ##ive force . oh , ok . that sounds a little better . maybe i will pursue this after all . it sure seems like it would be fun .

, then put them in an oven , sort of like you would with a barbecue in a masonry oven . that doesn ' t sound too difficult . how long does it take to ba ##ke a cake ?
you have to use prolonged dry heat in an oven , but it could be made even on hot ashes or stones . wow . is it just an american thing , or do other countries ba ##ke cakes ?
but i think it ' s interesting how two offspring can ##be produced at the same time . oh yeah . i have known a lot of twins in my life and i find it a pretty cool phenomenon .
life and i find it a pretty cool phenomenon . for fra ##tern ##al twins each twin is fe ##rta ##lized by its own sperm cell . are those the type of twins that don ' t look alike ?
they have two different combinations of dna the olsen twins are fra ##tern ##al but they look identical . i find that funny . but it makes sense because a lot of different aged siblings look just alike too .
too . that is actually refer ##ed to as do ##ppel ##gang ##ers ! oh i didn ' t know that . i heard that there are like 7 do ##ppel ##gang ##ers for each person in this world .
thought being a baker would be cool . i think i love the attraction of attempting different techniques with ic ##ing . if i were to choose to become a baker , i ' d be very fat lo ##l

it . i guess it was named on just an idea the creators had , fun fact it was named the dayton - hudson corporation after merging with the j . l . what is the j . l ?

! i was the younger brother so in that situation i would have probably been the one being held down . as a matter of fact he used make me watch scary movies . i still hate clown ##s !
